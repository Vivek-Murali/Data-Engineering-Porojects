Alien invaders known as the Neuroi came to Earth in 1939. This is not the first appearance of the Neuroi as they have appeared at seemingly random intervals throughout human history. While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth's natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity's main line of defense against the Neuroi.\nWith normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person. The series follows the battles fought by the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, who battle on the front lines to defend the British Isles from the Neuroi.

I would be interested in seeing how the underwear club develops, and in finding out more about her brother(?) who designs the underwear.  </p>","likesCount":1,"progress":null,"rating":12,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1536","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1536"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1536/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1536/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"217","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/217/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:03:38.095Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"gokusen","synopsis":"Kumiko Yamaguchi is smart, enthusiastic, and ready to start her dream job as a math teacher at Shirokin Academy.

In the present, Junichi is very\nmelancholy about his love life, but is presented with many ways to get the date he was never able to get. Basically, the story, which runs in omnibus\nformat, is about a guy named Junichi, who technically dates six or seven girls leading up to Christmas Eve. However the story itself runs, in the best\nway I can describe it, as if it has parallel universes. So no, he is not dating multiple girls at the same time... technically. Specifically, the\nstory, which is divided in to 4 episode arcs per girl, highlights the different stories that come with Junichi's relationships with each of the six\ngirls to hopefully get the Christmas Eve date he was not able to get beforehand.

The story, while not necessarily kicking off right where each arc in the first ended, adds on to those stories.

As a whole, because of the\nunique composition of Amagami SS, the second season sort of suffers in that each arc is only composed of 2 episodes. This is frankly not enough to\nwrite up any major developments to add to the stories established in the first season. Actually, to put it simply, these episodes were probably made\njust for the fans who were literally dying to see more of the show.Despite some of downsides I see to the show, I do enjoy it, but I don't commit to\nit as much as the richer experiences from other 12 episode shows. You will find some if not most of the happy and romantic qualities that the first\nseason had. In regards to conflicts, they, again, are not as drawn out as well as in the first season, but are a decent watch to say the least. I give\nthe show credit for what its worth.As someone who watched the first season and liked it a decent amount, I though SS+ Plus was good at best. It did\nwhat I expected it to do - maybe it added a bit more depth to each of the characters here and there, but I honestly did not find it that necessary to\nwatch - again, apart from one or two good arcs.

That said, all of\nthese shows had some sort of genius behind them, and Nichijou is the same way. \\*Very minor character spoilers in the paragraph below - nothing really\ndetrimental to the story in my opinion\\* Nichijou's cast is quite lovable to say the least. The show is initially divided into three groups.The first\nis the Shinonome Laboratory group, consisting of Hakase Shinonome (a really cute but attention seeking kid-professor), her robot, Nano Shinonome (who\nultimately wants to be like an ordinary teenaged girl), and their cat (a cat who talks due to one of Hakase's inventions; tries to be mature).The\nsecond is composed of three really awesome friends in high school: Yuuko (a somewhat stupid girl with some really stupid logic, but has some good\nthings going for her), Mio (practically the opposite of Yuuko \\[complimentary\\], but shares some of Yuulo's flaws as well), and Mai (Nichijou's\nresident troll ; practically the catalyst for many of the skits and jokes).The third is a wide array of side characters, such as Tachibana Misato\n(Nichijou's resident Tsundere, who, somehow, has many rocket launchers, turrents, and a P90 at her disposal), her crush, Sasahara Koujirou (a\ncharacter that sorta comes off as a douchebag but has some redeeming undertones to his personality), Sakurai Izumi (a shy, reserved homeroom teacher\nwho is naturally a pushover), and Manabu Takasaki (a teacher that crushes on Sakurai, but epicly fails during encounters he has with her).While this\nmay seem like a lot of characters to get a grasp of, you are given an 'almost equal' taste (in the way of skits) of each group in every single\nepisode and in no particular order. (I do say 'almost equal' because the story tends to favor the first two groups more - this makes sense since the\nthird group are considered supporting roles, but I feel that their roles in the show go way past the expectations of supporting roles.) In watching\nhow they carry out their lives, express themselves, interacting with each other, by the end of the series, you'll have a great feel for the\ncharacters and the roles their friends play in their lives. One of the major themes in Nichijou is friendship, which the story does a good job showing\nus. You will find that Nichijou has some serious, heartwarming moments that not only compliment the feel of the show, but also the feel for each of\nthe characters. Slice of life comedies put a lot of emphasis on humor rather than plot, which is where the genre gets lost for some. Nichijou, while\nnot necessarily plot driven, does contain a more concrete story in the second half of the series. In fact, while we're only given a little bit of\nplot, it does not feel 'half-assed' in any way as it does drive many of the skits along, and it also helps put a really nice and sweet ending to the\nshow (though some may argue that it was a bit underwhelming).I do feel like it is worth mention that Nichijou sorta reserves the right to gets away\nwith it's minimal plot as the literal translation for the name 'Nichijou' in English is 'Ordinary Life,' or more colloquially, 'Everyday Life'.\nThat is what this show does, depict the everyday life of the cast - nothing more, nothing less. Adding all these thoughts up, I think Nichijou met my\nexpectations content wise.There is no doubt that Nichijou looks a bit different, but who says that's a bad thing. It is important to note that\nNichijou's designs are almost completely taken from the manga it originated from. That said, while it may not feature the most favorable designs, it\ndoes make sense for the show in that it helps convey the same feel as the original, intended work.This 'animated comic book' like feel, in my\nopinion, compliments the type of story Nichijou actually is - its light, fun, not meant to be taken seriously - and adds to the whole mindset that\nanything can happen in the show. That said, Kyoto Animation really out did themselves with the animation and production quality of this show.Nichijou\nis fitted with all sorts of skits. For one, you have these really simple interactions between the characters. Animation on these, as expected, is\npractically flawless. However, a large part of Nichijou's claim to fame is due in part to its very overdramatic, hyper, overproduced, but\nridiculously hilarious slapstick skits. Quite literally, you'll get all of these epic 3D camera movements, and epic, vivid explosions on many\noccasions - often for stupid things (for example, saving a piece of food from hitting the floor). Not only that, but its fits shockingly well with the\ncomic art style. This is where I, as well as many other people agree that KyoAni did all of this random stuff, not because it was necessary, but\nbecause they simply can. Actually, some may even go as far as saying that KyoAni decided to play the mad scientist and made stuff happen just for the\nhell of it. I really cannot stress enough that all of the art, this included, contributes greatly to the overall comedic execution within Nichijou.\nFor that, I really praise KyoAni for their work on this. Speaking of comedy, I feel that Nichijou is one of the funniest shows I've seen yet,\nhowever, it is not all that perfect. There are going to be times when the jokes end up flying over your head and make you wonder whether or not the\nparticular skit was supposed to make you laugh or not.

That said, all of these shows had some sort of genius behind them, and Nichijou is the same way. *Very minor character spoilers in the paragraph below - nothing really detrimental to the story in my opinion* Nichijou's cast is quite lovable to say the least. The show is initially divided into three groups.The first is the Shinonome Laboratory group, consisting of Hakase Shinonome (a really cute but attention seeking kid-professor), her robot, Nano Shinonome (who ultimately wants to be like an ordinary teenaged girl), and their cat (a cat who talks due to one of Hakase's inventions; tries to be mature).The second is composed of three really awesome friends in high school: Yuuko (a somewhat stupid girl with some really stupid logic, but has some good things going for her), Mio (practically the opposite of Yuuko [complimentary], but shares some of Yuulo's flaws as well), and Mai (Nichijou's resident troll ; practically the catalyst for many of the skits and jokes).The third is a wide array of side characters, such as Tachibana Misato (Nichijou's resident Tsundere, who, somehow, has many rocket launchers, turrents, and a P90 at her disposal), her crush, Sasahara Koujirou (a character that sorta comes off as a douchebag but has some redeeming undertones to his personality), Sakurai Izumi (a shy, reserved homeroom teacher who is naturally a pushover), and Manabu Takasaki (a teacher that crushes on Sakurai, but epicly fails during encounters he has with her).While this may seem like a lot of characters to get a grasp of, you are given an 'almost equal' taste (in the way of skits) of each group in every single episode and in no particular order. (I do say 'almost equal' because the story tends to favor the first two groups more - this makes sense since the third group are considered supporting roles, but I feel that their roles in the show go way past the expectations of supporting roles.) In watching how they carry out their lives, express themselves, interacting with each other, by the end of the series, you'll have a great feel for the characters and the roles their friends play in their lives. One of the major themes in Nichijou is friendship, which the story does a good job showing us. You will find that Nichijou has some serious, heartwarming moments that not only compliment the feel of the show, but also the feel for each of the characters. Slice of life comedies put a lot of emphasis on humor rather than plot, which is where the genre gets lost for some. Nichijou, while not necessarily plot driven, does contain a more concrete story in the second half of the series. In fact, while we're only given a little bit of plot, it does not feel 'half-assed' in any way as it does drive many of the skits along, and it also helps put a really nice and sweet ending to the show (though some may argue that it was a bit underwhelming).I do feel like it is worth mention that Nichijou sorta reserves the right to gets away with it's minimal plot as the literal translation for the name 'Nichijou' in English is 'Ordinary Life,' or more colloquially, 'Everyday Life'. That is what this show does, depict the everyday life of the cast - nothing more, nothing less. Adding all these thoughts up, I think Nichijou met my expectations content wise.There is no doubt that Nichijou looks a bit different, but who says that's a bad thing. It is important to note that Nichijou's designs are almost completely taken from the manga it originated from. That said, while it may not feature the most favorable designs, it does make sense for the show in that it helps convey the same feel as the original, intended work.This 'animated comic book' like feel, in my opinion, compliments the type of story Nichijou actually is - its light, fun, not meant to be taken seriously - and adds to the whole mindset that anything can happen in the show. That said, Kyoto Animation really out did themselves with the animation and production quality of this show.Nichijou is fitted with all sorts of skits. For one, you have these really simple interactions between the characters. Animation on these, as expected, is practically flawless. However, a large part of Nichijou's claim to fame is due in part to its very overdramatic, hyper, overproduced, but ridiculously hilarious slapstick skits. Quite literally, you'll get all of these epic 3D camera movements, and epic, vivid explosions on many occasions - often for stupid things (for example, saving a piece of food from hitting the floor). Not only that, but its fits shockingly well with the comic art style. This is where I, as well as many other people agree that KyoAni did all of this random stuff, not because it was necessary, but because they simply can. Actually, some may even go as far as saying that KyoAni decided to play the mad scientist and made stuff happen just for the hell of it. I really cannot stress enough that all of the art, this included, contributes greatly to the overall comedic execution within Nichijou. For that, I really praise KyoAni for their work on this. Speaking of comedy, I feel that Nichijou is one of the funniest shows I've seen yet, however, it is not all that perfect. There are going to be times when the jokes end up flying over your head and make you wonder whether or not the particular skit was supposed to make you laugh or not. This should not deter you from watching though. I cannot stress enough that the vast majority of the jokes will have you ROFLing, as Nichijou's execution is top notch (some may say one of the best in the business), particularly in timing -after all, it is everything - and the ordering of the skits in particular episodes (hell, at some point you may see a funny skit cross an episode, which was a pretty hilarious surprise in my opinion). In fact, it can be pretty safe to say that this show has ways to surprise you with jokes, which definitely can definitely keep you watching.While I don't want to go on about the music (I'm going to totally omit talking abou the BGM), the two OPs the show has to offer are both crazy earworms. I personally love them as the hyper feel compliments the show very well. Additionally, I love the how KyoAni sequenced both OPs together with awesome pans and editing. I don't remember loving a sequence this much since Lucky Star's OP and the very popular Hare Hare Yukai ED from THAT other KyoAni work.

That`s how I found out about many shows I love, such as Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt, No.6 and more. It`s also how I found out about Hetalia.I went in to watch Hetalia with the same mind as any show I have watched. People on DA really, really like it, there`s nothing that seems bad about it from the fanart I have seen, so let`s give it a go! So I tried. And I am telling you all, I REALLY TRIED TO LIKE THIS SHOW.

Jirokichi Suzuki, who has just made most luxurious blimp in the World, challenges everyone’s favourite phantom\nthief Kaitou KID to steal the big jewel “Lady of the Sky” which is being transported on the blimp. Conan and his friends are on board like usual.\nHowever, the blimp gets hijacked by a group of terrorists who threaten to release a deadly virus onto the blimp. Conan and KID may have to work\ntogether in order to overcome this dangerous situation before the virus endangers the entire population of Kyoto.As stated, this movie is a huge\ndeparture from every single Detective Conan movie to date. Foregoing a plot driven by a murder mystery, the movie is mostly a thriller, relying on the\ngraphics, sound effects and the constant danger surrounding the protagonists to keep the audience engaged. Gone are the constant guesses at who the\nculprit is – you’re too busy worrying about the fate of the cast rather than trying to figure out how the murder was conducted.It may seem like a\ndaunting idea that there isn’t a person murdered under mysterious circumstances and Conan doing the detective work in the world of Case Closed, but\nthis movie is arguably the most gripping Conan movie seen in many years. Being the thriller that it is, it succeeded very well. Both the pacing and\nprogression are very good. It managed to keep me on the edge of my seat for the course of the entire movie and prevented my mind from drifting off\neven once. This is a feat that a Conan movie hasn’t accomplished in many years.As for the plot itself, it certainly lacks depth in comparison to most\nprevious Conan movies. This goes all the way from the plan, motive and even the execution. This is to be expected from a thriller – a genre that keeps\nthe audience’s heart beat fast instead of taxing the brain to work out what’s going on. For a TV series with more than 600 episodes full of the latter\nexperience, this movie is a fresh break from traditional Conan ordeals which plenty of us see on a weekly basis.The fact that this movie has Kaitou\nKID in it already makes it a must-watch for his army of fans. However, if you’re watching this movie for the composed, calculated phantom thief\nputting on an extravagant show for like he always does, prepare to be disappointed. There’s no such thing as a grand entrance, and epic theft and a\nperfect getaway in this movie. His role in this movie has been changed from the pivotal anti-hero to a support character who exist for slapstick\nhumour.This is the first time that Kaitou KID has been depicted in such a manner in the Detective Conan movie franchise, and is sure to frustrate and\nanger a lot of of his fans. However, as a true fan, I welcome the implementation of KID as such a character. Any reader of the original Magic Kaito\nseries should know that behind the scenes, KID isn’t the impeccable criminal mastermind who is as confident and composed as he is in front of his\naudience. In reality, he really is just Kaito Kuroba, a high school student who has a sense of humour and loves to have fun.Up to now, he has always\nbeen shown with his poker face in the Detective Conan series, as if he is another character. Finally, he is shown with his mask off in the Detective\nConan franchise. Many people are likely shocked by this sudden transformation, as if “his character is being ruined”. You need to realize that the\nKaitou KID in this movie, by no means, is out of character at all. In fact, this is his true face, which has been kept hidden from you who have\nexclusively seen Detective Conan. He’s still the lovable phantom thief whose amazing charisma will surely grip you again throughout the course of this\nmovie.The animation is again, beautifully accurate and fluid like all other Conan movies due to their remarkably high budget. The use of CG has been\ntoned down since the Raven Chaser, and the implementation is much more natural. As for the soundtrack, well, it’s pretty much the only thing that’s\nremained practically unchanged since the first movie, which isn’t bad. It’s as jazzy as ever and sets the atmosphere perfectly.As for all the other\nrecurring characters, they are faultlessly presented in this movie like usual. Nothing to complain about here. Ran is the damsel in distress. Kogoro\nis there for comic relief. The Detective Boys become the critical keys to success and Conan saves the day in the end as usual. Even Dr. Agasa’s dry\njoke still makes an appearance.The Lost Ship In The Sky certainly isn’t going to carter for everyone’s tastes, especially with the distinct shift of\ngenre from mystery to thriller. Also, the comedy has been toned up drastically in comparison to any Conan movie to date. The shift between\nlight-hearted and serious scenes are incredibly rapid. There’s a laugh in here every ten minutes or so throughout the whole movie, even in the tensest\nparts. Depending on you, it may make or break the entire experience. For me, it made the experience better, but I don’t represent the entire\npopulation.This movie has been the most enjoyable Conan movie for me since the The Phantom of Baker Street which released eight years ago, which I\nenjoyed for completely different reasons. This is the first Conan movie I have ever enjoyed simply due to its exciting, mindless fun. While I don’t\nwish for all future movies to follow in the same steps, this type of execution was perfect for The Lost Ship In The Sky. If you’re a Conan fan,\nwatching this movie is a no-brainer.P.S. You MUST watch the scene after the credits. It’s a direct continuation that is the true ending of the\nmovie.Comes with pictures if you read this review on my blog. :D http://imperialx.wordpress.com/2010/10/17/conan-movie-14-review/\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>First off, let me tell you right now: this isn’t your typical Detective Conan movie – in a good way.The Lost Ship In The Sky is the 14th addition to the Detective Conan movie franchise.

Returning the stolen goods isn't easy though, as Zenigata and the casino boss' ruthless gang are on Lupin and friends' tail. \n(Source: ANN)","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Lupin the Third: Operation Return the Treasure","en_jp":"Lupin III: Otakara Henkyaku Daisakusen!!","en_us":"Lupin III: Operation Return the Treasure","ja_jp":"ルパン三世: お宝返却大作戦！！"},"canonicalTitle":"Lupin III: Operation Return the Treasure","abbreviatedTitles":["Rupan Sansei"],"averageRating":"72.98","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"3","3":"0","4":"1","5":"0","6":"1","7":"0","8":"4","9":"1","10":"16","11":"2","12":"43","13":"1","14":"66","15":"1","16":"76","17":"0","18":"13","19":"1","20":"20"},"userCount":566,"favoritesCount":0,"startDate":"2003-08-01","endDate":"2003-08-01","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":6043,"ratingRank":2773,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"special","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1277/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1277/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1277/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1277/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1277/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":null,"episodeCount":1,"episodeLength":90,"totalLength":90,"youtubeVideoId":"","showType":"special","nsfw":false},"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1553/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1553/media"}},"user":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1553/relationships/user","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1553/user"}},"createdAt":"2013-03-13T13:16:36.736Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-19T07:59:12.274Z","content":"Watching a random Lupin special is a crapshoot in a rigged Mafia casino, but sometimes, you get lucky.

Why is it my favorite? Read\non.\n\n\"Who could have polluted the entire Earth?\" Such is the question posed by the film's titular protagonist. The world lies in shambles- man nearly\ndestroyed it completely during the Seven Days of Fire, using giant \"god warriors\" genetically engineered monstrosities built for war. The Earth's\nold infrastructure is ruined, and yet humanity goes on. Such is the post-apocalyptic world of *Nausicaä.*\n\nNausicaä, the protagonist, was born in the eponymous Valley of the Wind, home to a small, peaceful, farming village. She spends her days exploring the\ntoxic jungle just outside the valley on a small, powered glider.\n\nOne day, an airship crashes near her village carrying mysterious cargo, and soon, the village finds itself sitting in the middle of a war. For the\nsake of spoilers, I'll stop describing the film's events right here and start giving my impressions of the movie.\n\nAesthetically, *Nausicaä* is very strong. The movie's visuals have aged quite well- it looked good in 1984 and still looks good today. While there\nare a couple minor issues with color (in some shots it looks like [Nausicaä's not wearing her leggings][1]), each shot is vibrant and full of detail.\n\nThe movie's vehicles are especially noteworthy- most of them seem to have been inspired by WWII (especially the aircraft). As for alternative,\nslightly more organic means of transport, *Nausicaä* features gigantic flightless birds called \"Horseclaws\" which wound up serving as the\ninspiration for the chocobos of the *Final Fantasy* franchise and, quite likely, the ostrich horses of *The Last Airbender* universe.\n\nAs far as music goes, <em>Nausicaä </em>is excellent. The sweeping orchestral pieces are nicely complemented by the interspersing electronic pieces,\nand frankly, I can't get the theme music out of my head.\n\nThe story and characters are memorable- while there's lots of fantastical high-flying heroics, the characters (especially the protagonist) feel\nrather realistic. Nausicaä herself has a number of moments that make her feel more human- for the sake of spoilers I shan't mention what they are,\nbut Nausicaä is a warrior princess who despises war- she's got a heart, and that's a lot more than I can say for most action-heroes. Besides the\nprotagonist, each character has his and her own motivations, desires and personality- nobody feels clichéd- they could all be confused for real people\nunder the right circumstances.\n\nThere's interesting politics in the world of *Nausicaä*- the warring kingdoms that sandwich the Valley of the Wind have notably different leaders,\napparent internal tumult and unique cultures. My only real regret with the film is that I didn't get to learn more about the kingdoms of Pejite and\nTorumekia (though the manga the movie's based on does go into depth in the world of *Nausicaä*, and I honestly wish it could be converted to a\ntelevision series).\n\nThe story itself is unforgettable- while it *is* occasionally heavy-handed in it's ecological and anti-war message, it's very strong as a whole.\nEvery time I watch this film, it feels brand new. It makes me feel as if I'm soaring miles about the ground, and that's why it's my all-time\nfavorite movie.\n\nNOTE: The original English dub of *Nausicaä* was titled *Warriors of the Wind* and is widely regarded as terrible on account of its cutting out the\nfilm's ecological message along with plenty of other content. I haven't seen it and don't plan to. The 2005 re-release is *much* better.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/nausicaa/faq.html#bottom\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Writing an unbiased review of <em>Nausicaä</em> is difficult- it's hard to write an unbiased review of one's favorite movie.

Nausicaä herself has a number of moments that make her feel more human- for the sake of spoilers I shan't mention what they are, but Nausicaä is a warrior princess who despises war- she's got a heart, and that's a lot more than I can say for most action-heroes. Besides the protagonist, each character has his and her own motivations, desires and personality- nobody feels clichéd- they could all be confused for real people under the right circumstances.</p><p>There's interesting politics in the world of <em>Nausicaä</em>- the warring kingdoms that sandwich the Valley of the Wind have notably different leaders, apparent internal tumult and unique cultures. My only real regret with the film is that I didn't get to learn more about the kingdoms of Pejite and Torumekia (though the manga the movie's based on does go into depth in the world of <em>Nausicaä</em>, and I honestly wish it could be converted to a television series).</p><p>The story itself is unforgettable- while it <em>is</em> occasionally heavy-handed in it's ecological and anti-war message, it's very strong as a whole. Every time I watch this film, it feels brand new. It makes me feel as if I'm soaring miles about the ground, and that's why it's my all-time favorite movie.</p><p>NOTE: The original English dub of <em>Nausicaä</em> was titled <em>Warriors of the Wind</em> and is widely regarded as terrible on account of its cutting out the film's ecological message along with plenty of other content. I haven't seen it and don't plan to. The 2005 re-release is <em>much</em> better.</p>","likesCount":10,"progress":null,"rating":16,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1558","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1558"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1558/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1558/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"7209","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7209/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:52:05.775Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"amnesia","synopsis":"After fainting at work, a young lady awakens in the back room of the café she works at with no memory of her life or those around her.

It stays pretty true to the \"love story\" formula. What makes this anime really good is the excellent pacing it takes with the story. In many\n\"school life\" anime we always end up watching filler style episodes, only to have the end of the series be the only thing good about it. Not so for\nToradora however! It manages to keep the anticipation between the potential couples high, all along weaving together a pretty good in depth story that\nreally shows the heart of the characters. A lot of times we have scenes that show the characters trying to get the words out to express their\nfeelings, and others offer more side story scenarios-- which usually end up going in conjunction with a certain character’s inner turmoil and\nstruggle. Each episode flows nicely into the next, and you get some pretty clever comedy along the way. Now that is not to say that Toradora's story\nis without fault; not every episode is particularity interesting as others, towards the end the story tends to drag on a bit and feel somewhat rushed,\nand the characters start to get in a sort of \"pity party\" mood with their situations, which can get to be a bit of a downer at times. Still though,\nhaven’t all of us been there at one point in our lives, where we really want to say what is in our hearts, but end up holding back for risk of getting\nhurt? Or even worse, hurting another? Overall the story is filled with enough drama and guess work to keep the audience into it! Though it should be\nsaid that hardcore romance fans may be able to predict some of the twists and turns the plot takes. It does come close to becoming a bit of a harem\nanime, but just never quite reaches that category. The anticipation of \"who will end up with who?\" --is the stories strongest feature, and the\nending doesn't disappoint!!\n\nArt: 7/10  \nThe art really isn’t anything too special. You get a nice mixture of bright colorful characters and environments. The characters are sharp and well\nanimated with their facial expressions, but the backgrounds can look a bit washed out at times. And some of the action scenarios can be a bit on the\nstiff side. Again, the character’s faces are what stood out for me the most with the art, you really feel like you can read them at times.\n\nSound: 8/10  \nLike the visuals, I wouldn’t go on par to say that the music can be anything more than \"appropriate.\" You do get some pretty nifty opening and\nclosing songs, and they change mid way through the series. The BG music was nothing--if not forgettable. Even while writing this I can’t really think\nof a piece that stood out for me. What does make the soundtrack so good however, are the character voices! All of them were matched perfectly to a\n\"T, \" and I could not find a single voice actor to be out of place with their role. I especially enjoyed Taiga’s voice. She has this tough girl tone\nand attitude, yet you can tell that deep down inside she really does care about those around her. Something that the viewer will indeed discover while\nmaking their way through the anime.\n\nCharacters: 9/10  \nDefinitely the heart of Toradora! While going through this anime I really felt that I started a \"virtual\" style bond with them. I actually cared\nabout the problems they had, and wanted them to end up happy in the end. Towards the beginning, viewers may find a character or two that they either\ndislike or even despise. But trust me when I say this: \"stick with it!\" They end up evolving and have many twits to their persona! Taiga is really\nthe one who stole the show for me, she has so many layers to her personality that it can be hard to figure out just what is going through her head at\ntimes. A character named Minorin can be drop dead funny when she wants to be, and Ryuuji is a great guy that is always there for his friends. The best\ncompliment I can say about the cast? They act very human (ie: realistic), maybe a bit exaggerated at times, but mix the two together very well! Which\ncan be hard to do in an anime. My only real knock against the characters was, since there are multiple romance skits going on, at times it felt like\nsome of them were a bit too discreet with confessing to one another; which in turn can make the story slow paced at times. I almost felt like I wanted\nto jump inside my computer screen and yell: \"Oh just say it already!!!\" That aside, there really isn't much to complain about, great cast! \n\nEnjoyment: 10/10  \nDespite some of the glitches in the storyline, I still never the less found myself totally drawn into the world of Toradora! It had more than enough\nto offer to keep me wanting more! The mixture of comedy, romance, suspense and tender moments--really drew me in!\n\nOverall: 9/10  \nToradora makes us contemplate what is more important in life; love or friendship? This anime really turned out to be a great surprise for me. Sure its\ngot some flaws and all. But this series has it where it really counts; character chemistry and development! If you are a fan of romance anime,\ncomplimented with a great cast of characters and funny anecdotes. Then I highly recommend giving Toradora a try! It may not do anything new with its\nromance formula, but it does indeed do it right!\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>I thought Toradora would be your normal school romance anime which follows two people trying to achieve love of their life. But low and behold it came out to be surprisingly good, and has quickly become one of my favorite anime series. </p><p>Story: 9/10</p><p>The story revolves around Ryuuji and Tiaga, two ordinary students that end up working together in order to help one another end up with the ones they love.

The demography reaches out to both Shonen and Seinen crowds.\nThe concepts of time traveling, time paradox, time looping, time leaping, and the butterfly effect were all presented very well. They were explained\nwith a fluent, consistent logic and the concepts are supported by using time lines (in the show they call it world lines, when really it’s almost\nsaying “parallel universe”.) Some may criticize Okabe’s ability to retain his memories through his “Reading Steiner”, which I personally choose to\nignore for reasons I will say at the end of the review.  \nThe setting is in modern day society and the conflict is between our main characters and a secret organization called SERN. The whole SERN conflict\nshows this kind of Terminator-feel to the overall plot and Okabe is basically John Connor in retrospect to the beloved Terminator series. Overall, the\nstory is greatly supported by the several types of conflicts and plot progression being utilized all throughout the series. Steins;Gate also consists\nof addicting suspense that supplements the story with a fluent, chain-linked consistency that makes you crawl back for more—a well done job.\n\nCharacters are usually all too static in anime, rather than dynamic such as those you find in some Hollywood produced dramas. Here in this particular\nseries, there is a gold mine of dynamic-range for personality and human-quality. A lot of the characters share this quality and all have some elements\nthat any one person could relate to somehow. \n\nLet’s start with Okabe Rintarou. He is just this loveable, hilarious mad scientist that starts off as a comic relief by acting as a mad conspiracy\ntheorist. There are several attempts in different series that attempt the main character to act as a comic relief; Okabe accomplishes this attempt\nwith ease such as characters from Gintama would capture attention. Albeit, the Engrish and Kurisu jokes could get old for some(I personally never get\ntired of his Engrish due to the excellent voice acting by Miyamo, Mamoru,) he has his frequent moments where you can’t help but to burst into\nhysterics. Besides the comic relief, he also has the strongest human quality. He shows a unique dynamic in such a way that nobody would expect: at\nfirst he is a seemingly arrogant college student that is a flamboyant conspiracy theorist, then later on he develops many different states of mind and\nexpresses a diverse range of emotion/mood, finally he resets back to his normal self and shows empowerment. Okabe is by far one of the strongest\ncharacters I have ever analyzed in an anime title.\n\nAh, a fan favorite: Makise Kurisu. She is as tsundere as they come—in a good way though! The presentation of her tsun side definitely shows the dere\nin moderation; they definitely kept this cliché at an appropriate level—making her, in my opinion, one of the better tsunderes in the anime world. As\na main character, she too has a dynamic personality that develops as well. Even the tsundere part of her personality supplements her character\ndevelopment, like all “dere” types should accomplish. Her dynamic spectrum is unique to the tsundere type: she appears at first to be a stubborn\nknow-it-all, and then they utilize the tsun-tsun personality to such consistency that later on it makes sense that she’d eventually show some\nweakness. She too later becomes an empowered character and my respect for this is inexpressible. \n\n*Tuturu~!* Mayushi is certainly the clearest example and definition of “cute”. Hit-or-miss, give-or-take, you can’t really get pissed off at her\ncharacter mainly due to the fact that she can be anybody’s friend at any cost. Being the role of the “childhood friend” of Okabe, she shows an\nexcellent example of exactly what friendship is. She is always so happy and optimistic, and then becomes somewhat of a push over because of her pure\nmaiden self—always too kind to really voice herself unless it was urgent (this exact point here is what drives the plot for half of the series with\nOkabe.) Lastly, she shows her dedication to keep true to her friendship to motivate a depressed Okabe and return him to his original character with\nher traits alone. Head-to-toe, inside-and-out, she brings joy to all viewers at some point. \n\nSUPA-HACKA DARU!!! Itaru fills in the role of the typical otaku, with the twist of being a super hacker. He is a fan of another main character Feiris\nNyanNyan and shows his otaku qualities through his worship of her. The majority of his character is utilized as comic relief. He is, however funny and\nloveable. Outside of his perverted sense of humor at times, he does express emotional value at times such as: shock, sadness, and even shows constant\ndetermination as technician and hacker. \n\nHere we have Suzuha Amane, a fun and high-spirited girl that would never seem to have anything mysterious about her until after the plot develops.\nSimple words I can say to describe her is that she is a curious character. She is a tomboy in all aspects, she rocks the look and has the swag and\ncuteness factor to pull it off. She too has her human qualities: she is viewed with this enthusiastic persona, then is an ever so weary and shows\nthreatening body language, then shows the same determination that Daru has, then becomes stressed, and then back to her normal self. Here we start to\nsee a trend of the characters all returning to their normal states…\n\nFeiris NyanNyan~ She is simply the other moe factor alongside Mayushi and plays the role of the ever-so cute neko girl. A fun, energetic, cute,\nlovable, and playful girl puts the sugar to the spice in this show. Her trend for personality is less dynamic than the rest of the characters: starts\noff as a cute, playful neko girl, then begins to break down emotionally and falls in love, then returns to normal later on.\n\n“Urushibara Ruka. The mannerisms and voice of a woman... No... More feminine than any woman. But he's a guy. Taller than Mayuri, but so very thin...\nBut he's a guy. Looks great in a miko outfit... But he's a guy. It's already twilight And yet, it's so hot. The cicadas are crying. But... He's a\nguy.” –Okabe. Okabe pretty much hit the bullseye on Ruka’s entire character—the dangerous bishonen. The moe factor is deceitful, yet so powerfully\ncute. He is kind, shy and awfully self-conscious overall. There are slight dynamics for Ruka such as playing shy, later sucking up and becoming a bit\nbrave for once, experiences heart break, then follows the trend of returning to normal. A bit flatter than the rest of the characters, but still is a\nvery entertaining character.\n\nMoeka is the last person I wanted to cover, note my sarcasm. She is the fan base’s least favorite due to her involvement in the plot. She plays the\nrole of the popular pretty girl, although it seems as though she acts like a mute… odd combination there for sure. She is easily and reasonably a\nhate-able character because of her total structure and involvement, just everything about her can give her hate—yet this is why she receives so much\nattention from the fans. She is interesting; however, that she has this psychological issue from the obvious attachment to her cellular device. Even\nshe can receive love from some fans due to her “emo” part of her. Her human qualities are a bit odd and she could come straight out of an Edgar Allen\nPoe tale: she comes off as a dandere at first, then turns absolutely insane, then goes back to her dandere self. It’s a bit bland compared to even\nRuka, but she receives the right amount of attention anyways from her demograph.\n\nThe character designs are well done, original and very contemporary. The movement and flow of the characters are flawless as well as the background\nand scenery. The concept illustrations of world lines and such are presented with amazing touch without the use of any computer graphics. Over all ten\nout of ten for art.\n\nThe voice acting is excellent, emotionally moving, adorable, and unpredictable with the dialogue alone. The emotional drive that comes from the voice\nactors at certain parts are so well done, that their contribution to the entertainment is one of the key factors of a superb feeling a viewer may get\nwhile watching the show.  \nI noticed that most of the time, the music is either very low or non-existent. I find this to be appropriate for this show and not some cheesy\nxylophone sounding music during casual moments. During the softer, more melodramatic times they sound a piano piece that utterly captures, raptures\nyour attention and emotion and manipulates the atmosphere and feel of the moment. The score is excellent and consistent.\n\nThe opening song “Hacking to the Gate” by Kanako Itou is an anime masterpiece in of itself. Here’s why I say this: the beats are set at an acceptable\ntone/volume, the guitars are kept at a constant rhythm that gives a good name to J-Rock for those who are especially unfamiliar to the genre, the\nvocals are pretty good (the vibrato isn’t heavily used in her voice, her tone and pitch are stunning, and she has a very powerful voice—I think I just\nbecame a fan of hers.) The ending song “Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku by Yui Sakakibara” is another appropriate song for this series that starts\noff with a soft instrumental that should really get you on the tip of your chair, awaiting for something epic. It is a mellow song and interesting at\nthe same time.\n\nFunny how the genre of Steins;Gate is “thriller”; I was thrilled in the sense of utter excitement. My eyes were literally glued to the screen as I,\nwhile doing my usual Otakuthon, watched each episode with the suspense one would have when receiving X-Mas presents. There were many moments where I\nwould burst out into laughter, rewinding those parts obnoxiously. There were times where I simply balled out crying, tearing up so much that I had to\npause the show in order to finish crying up a river. There were also times that had me blush for how utterly cute and adorable some of the scenes\nwere—be it romantic or moe. Even as a guy, I found a lot of the material awesome.\n\nThere is my full criticism and review of Steins;Gate. I gave it a ten-out-of-ten status mostly because of the emotional roller coaster I had with it.\nIt isn’t about “how believable” an anime may be no matter how close to reality it is trying to resemble. We all watch and seek entertainment simply to\nbe entertained. Albeit there are many, upon many things that needs criticism. I just didn’t feel that this particular show deserved hardly any\ncriticism, so my overflowing hormones force me to over look some of these in-depth details. Can’t wait for the specials and many more things to come\nalong from this series! **El. Psy. Congroo.**\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i><b>Tutturu~! </b></i></p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>The genre of Steins;Gate, from what I observed, was Sci-Fi, Thriller, Drama, and Romance.

Here we start to see a trend of the characters all returning to their normal states…</p><p>Feiris NyanNyan~ She is simply the other moe factor alongside Mayushi and plays the role of the ever-so cute neko girl. A fun, energetic, cute, lovable, and playful girl puts the sugar to the spice in this show. Her trend for personality is less dynamic than the rest of the characters: starts off as a cute, playful neko girl, then begins to break down emotionally and falls in love, then returns to normal later on.</p><p>“Urushibara Ruka. The mannerisms and voice of a woman... No... More feminine than any woman. But he's a guy. Taller than Mayuri, but so very thin... But he's a guy. Looks great in a miko outfit... But he's a guy. It's already twilight And yet, it's so hot. The cicadas are crying. But... He's a guy.” –Okabe. Okabe pretty much hit the bullseye on Ruka’s entire character—the dangerous bishonen. The moe factor is deceitful, yet so powerfully cute. He is kind, shy and awfully self-conscious overall. There are slight dynamics for Ruka such as playing shy, later sucking up and becoming a bit brave for once, experiences heart break, then follows the trend of returning to normal. A bit flatter than the rest of the characters, but still is a very entertaining character.</p><p>Moeka is the last person I wanted to cover, note my sarcasm. She is the fan base’s least favorite due to her involvement in the plot. She plays the role of the popular pretty girl, although it seems as though she acts like a mute… odd combination there for sure. She is easily and reasonably a hate-able character because of her total structure and involvement, just everything about her can give her hate—yet this is why she receives so much attention from the fans. She is interesting; however, that she has this psychological issue from the obvious attachment to her cellular device. Even she can receive love from some fans due to her “emo” part of her. Her human qualities are a bit odd and she could come straight out of an Edgar Allen Poe tale: she comes off as a dandere at first, then turns absolutely insane, then goes back to her dandere self. It’s a bit bland compared to even Ruka, but she receives the right amount of attention anyways from her demograph.</p><p>The character designs are well done, original and very contemporary. The movement and flow of the characters are flawless as well as the background and scenery. The concept illustrations of world lines and such are presented with amazing touch without the use of any computer graphics. Over all ten out of ten for art.</p><p>The voice acting is excellent, emotionally moving, adorable, and unpredictable with the dialogue alone. The emotional drive that comes from the voice actors at certain parts are so well done, that their contribution to the entertainment is one of the key factors of a superb feeling a viewer may get while watching the show.<br>I noticed that most of the time, the music is either very low or non-existent. I find this to be appropriate for this show and not some cheesy xylophone sounding music during casual moments. During the softer, more melodramatic times they sound a piano piece that utterly captures, raptures your attention and emotion and manipulates the atmosphere and feel of the moment. The score is excellent and consistent.</p><p>The opening song “Hacking to the Gate” by Kanako Itou is an anime masterpiece in of itself. Here’s why I say this: the beats are set at an acceptable tone/volume, the guitars are kept at a constant rhythm that gives a good name to J-Rock for those who are especially unfamiliar to the genre, the vocals are pretty good (the vibrato isn’t heavily used in her voice, her tone and pitch are stunning, and she has a very powerful voice—I think I just became a fan of hers.) The ending song “Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku by Yui Sakakibara” is another appropriate song for this series that starts off with a soft instrumental that should really get you on the tip of your chair, awaiting for something epic. It is a mellow song and interesting at the same time.</p><p>Funny how the genre of Steins;Gate is “thriller”; I was thrilled in the sense of utter excitement. My eyes were literally glued to the screen as I, while doing my usual Otakuthon, watched each episode with the suspense one would have when receiving X-Mas presents. There were many moments where I would burst out into laughter, rewinding those parts obnoxiously. There were times where I simply balled out crying, tearing up so much that I had to pause the show in order to finish crying up a river. There were also times that had me blush for how utterly cute and adorable some of the scenes were—be it romantic or moe. Even as a guy, I found a lot of the material awesome.</p><p>There is my full criticism and review of Steins;Gate. I gave it a ten-out-of-ten status mostly because of the emotional roller coaster I had with it. It isn’t about “how believable” an anime may be no matter how close to reality it is trying to resemble. We all watch and seek entertainment simply to be entertained. Albeit there are many, upon many things that needs criticism. I just didn’t feel that this particular show deserved hardly any criticism, so my overflowing hormones force me to over look some of these in-depth details. Can’t wait for the specials and many more things to come along from this series! <b>El. Psy.

The story of\nRinne no Lagrange is a confusing one, in that it's a fantasy series where none of the fantasy elements are ever given explanation. What exactly are\nthe Vox? Are they bad or good, and how are they related to the apocalypse? Why are the nations of De Metrio and Le Garite warring with each other?\nWhat is with those huge flower things in the sky? None of this is given a clear answer, and since these are the things which the main story revolves\naround, it causes the whole thing to fall apart.And yet it's all tolerable to the point where it's actually rather enjoyable in a non-ironic way.\nMost of the characters themselves are well-written; I wouldn't exactly call them deep or anything, but they have likable personalities, and they're\ndramatic needs were believable and clearly expressed--even if the plot surrounding these dramatic needs was not. You may not understand why Madoka and\nthe others are battling against the powers of darkness (or something), you still enjoy watching them do so because of how likable they are.This in\npart is due to the slice-of-life qaulities of the first season, which allowed you to feel more attached to the characters. The first season also had\nthe problem of infusing these qualities with the more dramatic parts of the story, which consequently made it hard to take certain scenes seriously.\nAlthough the straight-up slice-of-life scenes are toned down in Season 2, it still has the problem of having a light-hearted atmosphere when it would\nprobably have done better if it could have taken itself more seriously.It seems as if the writers put so much focus into the characters and\nslice-of-life elements, that they never bothered to put much thought into the actual plot. Nothing was really even presented as \"questions\"--all of\nthe characters just went along with the flow of events as if they already knew the nature of the Vox, or why De Metro and Le Garite were\nwarring.Despite this, Season 2 still manages to have its share of emotional moments, which only get better as the series progresses. However,\nsometimes you'll be enchanted by one of these wonderfully presented scenes, only for some other aspect of the plot to ruin it--canceling out what\ncould be seen as a redeeming quality.

There are also a lot of people calling Jinrui the hipster's anime, in both the positive and negative\nsense of the word.Jinrui is a weird series, and in fact the weirdest thing I've seen in recent memory. Yet, it stands out from most of the other\n\"weird\" anime, in that there's not really anything stereotypical about it's weirdness (in contrast to other weird shows such as Full Metal Panic\nor Sora no Otoshimono.) You've got cat-eared androids, suicidal toast robots, and \"paradogs\" (paradox dogs), among other ridiculous concepts\nthroughout, and you get the feeling that the weirdness isn't simply done for shits and giggles, or just for the sake of being weird; rather it adds\ndepth to the series.The android-arc brings forth yet another \"Do Androids Dream\" story, but does so in a way that's both original and\nthought-provoking (and not simply because the androids are cat-eared,) and the fairy societies of episode 9 and 10 are analogous to how fickle many\nsocieties are in the long run. Even the many improbabilities within the setting contribute to this by giving the setting a fantastical and whimsical\natmosphere. I imagine there are plenty of fans who love Jinrui simply because of how different it is (i.e., the hipsters,) but coincidentally it's\nthe things that make it stand out that make it so intelligent.None of this is quite evident until episode 6, however. The first five episodes, almost\nhalf of the series, utilize an excessive amount of dialogue and deadpan snarking to the point where it undermines any of the good qualities. The\ndialogue gives the impression that this is a poor adaption of a light novel, while the deadpan snarking just makes all the wittiness seem snobbish.\nIt's boring, and doesn't engage you. There's certainly thought-provoking things to be found, but you're too distracted by the show's faults to\nreally care.Ironically, when Jinrui isn't bogged down by dialogue and snarking, it' stands as an anime that showcases all of animations strongpoints\nas a story-telling medium. The visuals and sound are put to much better use to express the emotions and plot of the story, instead of spoon-feeding it\nwith dialogue; giving the series an atmosphere that only animation can accomplish. Many of the shows weirder elements are also things best told with\nanimation, similar to the likes of FLCL.Although the plot is nice and well written, the characters themselves are overtly simplistic and\nuninteresting. They all do well to move the plot forward, but it's never more than five minutes that each character ever becomes compelling in and of\nthemselves. A big exception to this would be Watashi and Y, who both undergo some heavy character development in the final two episodes.Another thing\nis that Jinrui presents itself as comedy, and although it may be intelligent, it's just not as funny as it could be. All of the jokes have potential,\nbut more often than not they're not quite executed well enough. This also likely due to poor adaption of the source material.All in all, Jinrui has\nits fair share of mediocrity--especially with the first five episodes, and it's not quite a great as people claim it to be.

But it certainly has its moments of brilliance, full of wit and emotion. </p>","likesCount":3,"progress":null,"rating":14,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false}],"meta":{"count":13187},"links":{"first":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=0","prev":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=0","next":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=40","last":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=13167"},"headers":{"date":"Mon, 06 Jun 2022 07:15:55 GMT","content-type":"application/vnd.api+json","transfer-encoding":"chunked","connection":"close","x-frame-options":"SAMEORIGIN","x-xss-protection":"1; mode=block","x-content-type-options":"nosniff","x-download-options":"noopen","x-permitted-cross-domain-policies":"none","referrer-policy":"strict-origin-when-cross-origin","vary":"Accept, Origin","etag":"W/\"863e51e471f183113df99457c50c06c0\"","cache-control":"max-age=0, private, must-revalidate","x-request-id":"c5d86b6d-fe5f-45b1-af13-be2664b05774","x-runtime":"0.185176","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; preload","cf-cache-status":"DYNAMIC","expect-ct":"max-age=604800, report-uri=\"https://report-uri.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/beacon/expect-ct\"","report-to":"{\"endpoints\":[{\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\/report\\/v3?s=VP4WixEuu838rkNGNo6MgXstb6NUE2zgXUoeZEBu0Y%2F3OU89QJBrjiq%2BanQqbOD%2FbO989HHFkJkII%2Fws%2BysUlC0h3Qj6xpQIU6%2BtaSCvz1mLBGrAqvXDDMymKA%3D%3D\"}],\"group\":\"cf-nel\",\"max_age\":604800}","nel":"{\"success_fraction\":0,\"report_to\":\"cf-nel\",\"max_age\":604800}","server":"cloudflare","cf-ray":"716f5c0b5a8b76c6-LHR","alt-svc":"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400, h3-29=\":443\"; ma=86400"}},{"data":[{"id":"1575","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1575"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1575/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1575/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"5323","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5323/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:21:58.225Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"heaven-s-lost-property-forte","synopsis":"Sakurai Tomoki has settled into his life with the two angeloids, Ikaros and Nymph, and is enjoying himself immensely.

I love\nthe series for it's crazy over-the-top comedy, and the occasional bit of successful melodrama that it manages to add in, even if the characters are\nall a bit shallow.But for some reason, Forte came off as a lot more sexist. Although there certainly some sexism in the first season, it was either\njustified by the context of the story (such as the initial objectification of the angeloids), or it just wasn't really noticeable enough to get in\nthe way of the comedy. Maybe I've just gotten better at spotting sexism within fiction, but there were a few times where Forte's sexism actually did\nruin the comedy, and sometimes they even seem to cross the line between fanservice and objectification, without justification. There are a few scenes\nin particular that I'd like to point out:The first is episode 4, in which Mikako organizes a huge snowball fight between the male and female students\nof the school. In the battle, the women seem to solely rely on huge catapults to chuck boulders of snow at the men, while the men are ridiculously\ngood at actually using their arms to throw the snowballs, easily overpowering any of the women in close-range combat. Although it's true that men\ngenerally have better arm strength than women, scenes like this that greatly exaggerate the difference power between the sexes, sends the message that\nwomen are weak, and don't stand a chance against the unstoppable force of men.What's worse is when later in the episode, Tomoki and other men take\nthe character Astarea and a dozen of the women as prisoners, and proceed to tickle their breasts against their will; a fanservice scene utilizing the\nsame kind of sexual harassment that Tomoki often partakes in, except now it's a group of boys doing it instead of just him. What's really bad about\nthis scene though (if mass sexual harassment wasn't bad enough,) is that Tomoki ends up taking off his pants, drawing an elephant's head above his\npenis, and snickering as he approaches a tied up Astarea. Snickering like a rapist, or a molester. Even for a character like Tomoki, that's\njust...man, what were the writer's thinking?Then there's episode 9, in which Mikako sets up another game, in which teenage girls are tied up, and\nthrown into a pool for the men (and some women, but mostly men) to dive in and fish them out. They are treated as fish, and presumably are doing this\nagainst their will. Probably the worst case of objectification in the series, in that the women are literally treated as objects. It's also another\nevent that Mikako organizes, but that's hardly an excuse.The dramatic elements of the series were also worse, since a lot of it dragged on, such as\nNymph's constant wishing that she had a master and wings, and Ikaro's constant questioning of what love is. They introduced these dramatic conflicts\nin the first episode, and constantly reminded us about them with little character development until the climax of episode 11. I honestly stopped\ncaring about Nymph's story arc when we got a fourth (maybe fifth) inner monologue about how she wishes Tomoki could be her master and restore her\nwings, which was pretty much identical to all the monologues she had before. The only subplot that really interested me was Sugata's adventure's\ninto Synapse. In fact, I wish Sugata got more screentime, since he's easily the most interesting character of the cast. He would kind of make a\nbetter protoganist too; even if Tomoki is the center of the harem, and is hinted to be some sort of \"chosen one\", Sugata's the one doing most of\nthe mystery solving.Despite all these apparent flaws, sometimes it seems as if Sora no Otoshimono is a stealth parody of harem shows, hentai, and the\nweirder television shows that anime is often stereotyped as. If you take away the comically over-the-top context of the hijinks that the main\ncharacters get themselves into, it sounds just like the kind of stuff you would hear about from any shallow parody of anime; Tomoki transforming into\na giant watermelon and attempting tentacle rape, Tomoki fusing himself with the school pool so he can grope female swimmers, Sohara's anger\nmanifesting itself as a giant snowman, etc. etc.Tomoki's pervert attitude is also an obvious aversion to the chivalrous protagonist found in\nvirtually every harem show; then there's the fact that Tomoki manages to get four girls to fall in love with him, despite his perverted attitude, as\nif they only like him because he's the protagonist... Perhaps in a bout of depression and anxiety over the state of the anime and manga industry, Suu\nMinazuku created this series as \"take that\" to the many cliches and tropes often found in ecchi comedies? Or maybe he created the series as an\n\\*affectionate\\* parody?Anyways, for the most part it's still an okay series, but Forte just came off as a lot worse than it's predecessor.\nHopefully the 2011 movie (which I have yet to see), and the upcoming third season are better, but Forte has caused me to seriously doubt the quality\nof this series.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>I finally got around to watching the second season to Sora no Otoshimono, and it's caused me to form a love/hate relationship with the series.

And game-to-cinema adaptions don’t really have a high standard anyways, so this is probably the best adaption also.\nHowever, this is ultimately one of the main reasons why The Animation fails to be as good as the original game. (And since the original game’s story\nwas merely “good” in my eyes, this causes The Animation to sink down into mediocre.)There seems to be misconception that if an adaption is faithful\nenough to the source material, than it’s garanteed to be good-so long as the source material was good in the first place. This is incorrect because\nwhen a story is written for certain medium, it tends to work best in that medium because that’s what the story was designed for. Persona 4\nfundamentally works best as a video-game, because that’s what it was written for. You could still make a good television series out of it, but in\norder for that to happen you have to actually change stuff and play around with it.The first of these problems is the pacing. Persona 4 is a game\nwhere you live out the player-protagonist’s highschool life day by day, with trips to the TV world every few weeks. It takes about 60-80 hours to\nbeat, and features a very slow pacing. For a 25 episode television series, they of course would need to compress the overall story.For example, it’s\nnot until a whole hour into the game until the player-protagonist actually gets to fight some Shadows. Since fighting Shadows is apart of the show’s\npremise, you of course need to include that in the pilot. Therefor, the writers had to rush through the first hour of the game and compress into a\n20-minute episode, which results in an overtly fast pacing.Secondly is the formulaic structure that comprises the majority of the plot. It roughly\ngoes something like this: “Episode A: The heroes find out who’s on the Midnight Channel, and try to gather information on them so that they can save\nthem from the TV world –&gt; Episode B: The heroes go into the TV world, and rescues the victim. The victim then joins their party and helps out in\nthe next story arc–&gt; Episode C: Filler episode –&gt; Repeat.”The formula was no problem in the game, since the slow pacing made it so you barely\neven noticed the formula in the first place. However, since the formula goes through a mere three episodes of the anime, the quicker pacing makes it\nseem more repetitive.Lastly, there’s Yu’s ability to summon multiple Persona’s, and acquire ”Social Links.” In the video-game, these are only briefly\nexplained, but it’s no problem because it makes sense in the context of a video-game. But with The Animation, they still don’t bother to give an\nin-depth explanation, and it no longer makes any sense because it doesn’t have the context of a game to back it up. In the game it makes complete\nsense from a game play mechanic, but in The Animation it serves absolutely no purpose other than to occasionally show off some of the obtainable\ndemons.This is one of those shows where it starts out rather nicely; even though the first few episodes suffered from such overtly-fast pacing, they\nwere otherwise rather enjoyable and of decent quality. After episode 4 however, the series started to steep deeper and deeper into mediocracry, and it\nwasn’t until episode 21 (near the end of the series) that it finally started to be of exceptional quality. This is partially due to how the series\nquickly starts to focus less on the mystery aspects of the plot, and more on the formulaic nature of rescuing people from the TV world and forming\nSocial Links. In other words, barely anything interesting actually happened for a large part of the series.When each character is introduced in their\nrespective story-arcs, they are indeed compelling characters with a good amount of depth to them. However, as soon as they face their inner selves and\nare rescued from the TV world, they quickly degrade into flat one-dimensional characters. They’re all still likable to a certain extent, but not\nenough to make slice-of-life episodes (i.e. the filler episodes) worth watching.The fight scenes were also underwhelming, usually feeling rushed. They\nbarely have any tension to them, and usually ended far sooner than you would have liked them to. A few times they tried to mix up the fights by adding\nin some zany element, such as the male characters turning into old men, or the a hot liquid appearing on the floor that impaired the characters\nmovements. Sometimes it worked, but other times it was just added a bit of stupid and unnecessary comedy.If there’s anything that saves this show from\nbeing terribly mediocre, it’s the final four episodes that manage to pull a few plot twists and make the whole mystery plot actually\ninteresting.Overall Rating: 6/10. For the most part this is a mediocre series, but it had enough saving qualities for me to rate this as “above\naverage.” For a short while each character was compelling and complex, and the last four episodes were of exceptional quality.But even so, I highly\nrecommend you avoid this series, and just play the original video-game. I wouldn't call the game a masterpiece or anything, but it's certainly\nbetter than The Animation is virtually every way.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>The majority of people seem to praise Persona 4: The Animation for its faithfulness to the source material, calling it “the best game-to-anime adaption ever made.” As someone who finished their first playthrough of the game while the series was almost halfway through syndication, I’ll agree, the series is certainly faithful. And game-to-cinema adaptions don’t really have a high standard anyways, so this is probably the best adaption also. However, this is ultimately one of the main reasons why The Animation fails to be as good as the original game. (And since the original game’s story was merely “good” in my eyes, this causes The Animation to sink down into mediocre.)There seems to be  misconception that if an adaption is faithful enough to the source material, than it’s garanteed to be good-so long as the source material was good in the first place. This is incorrect because when a story is written for certain medium, it tends to work best in that medium because that’s what the story was designed for.

This is probably due to the\nfact that it was released at a time where most localized anime geared for adults was rather mature and gritty (think Evangelion or Cowboy Bebop,)\nwhile this was more immature and lighthearted. Regardless of why other people like it, I did not enjoy it; finding it to be rather boring and\nuninspiring.There's nothing particularly good about the story or plot, but that's forgivable seeing how this is a comedy. It's about three\nhighschool girls, A-ko, B-ko, and C-ko, (literally “Girl A,” Girl B,” and “Girl C.”) A-Ko and C-ko are best friends–the former of which happens to\nhave super strength and speed. B-ko is A-ko's rival from kindergarten, and has a crush on C-ko, and thus uses her mad scientists skills to constantly\nchallenge A-ko in an attempt to win C-ko's heart. There's also an alien invasion later on.The biggest problem with this film is that more often than\nnot, it's unfunny and doesn't deliver as a comedy. Supposedly there is a fist full of references parodying various anime from the 1980s, and a large\nportion of the comedy relies on these references. If this is true, than that would explain why I didn't really find Project A-ko to be very\nenjoyable. As far as Japanese cartoons go, I'm not exactly well cultured when it comes to anything prior to the '90s, so most of these references\nwere invisible to me. I did catch the jibe they made at Fist of the North Star, which I found pretty hilarious–so had I been able to understand all\nthe other references, maybe I would have liked this more. I doubt it would have much of a difference however.Perhaps it's not the best idea for me to\ncriticize for not \"understanding\" it, but I can at least say this: comedies that rely on parodying other stories tend to not age well. As time\npasses, less and less people will be able to appreciate the work, until eventually only a niche group of people will be able to truly appreciate it.\nSome more time later and maybe no one will understand it–which is actually kind of depressing, but hey, that's how it is.As I said, the story and\nplot is nothing special, and this in part due to the fact that all of the characters are rather shallow and uninteresting. B-ko is your typical\none-dimensional villain/rival, who really wants nothing more but to kill A-ko and win the heart of C-ko–which was probably supposed to be funny, but\nwasn't. C-ko in particular is rather annoying and unlikable, as all she ever does is act like some sort of seven year old, and cries whenever someone\ncalls her out for being a cloudcukoolander. Which again, was probably supposed to be funny, but wasn't. A-ko would be the best of the characters, but\nonly because there's nothing particularly good or bad about her.The only thing about Project-Ako that's consistently good would be the huge action\nsequence in the final thirty minutes of the film. It starts with A-ko and B-ko's final duel, and than sort of escalates once the city is attacked by\naliens. It's ridiculous and exciting, and actually pretty enjoyable. One scene that stand outs is when A-ko ascends to the floating alien spaceship\nby hopping on and off missiles that are being shot in her direction.Since Project A-ko is considered to be one of the classics, you might want to\nwatch it anyways–just don't except anything to be enjoyable apart from the action sequences.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Among the Western fanbase of Japanese cartoons, there is apparently quite a lot of people who like the film Project A-ko.

Though he would much rather stick to the world of 2D, he is trapped in lousy reality, and so Keima must trudge forward in his conquest of love.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"The World God Only Knows II","en_jp":"Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai II","en_us":"The World God Only Knows II","ja_jp":"神のみぞ知るセカイ II"},"canonicalTitle":"The World God Only Knows II","abbreviatedTitles":["Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai 2","Kaminomi II","The World God Only Knows 2"],"averageRating":"79.42","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"105","3":"11","4":"38","5":"3","6":"65","7":"7","8":"345","9":"10","10":"574","11":"30","12":"1480","13":"65","14":"4369","15":"161","16":"6268","17":"142","18":"3037","19":"34","20":"3861"},"userCount":31415,"favoritesCount":254,"startDate":"2011-04-12","endDate":"2011-06-28","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":315,"ratingRank":722,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6026/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6026/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6026/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6026/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6026/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6026/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6026/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6026/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6026/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":12,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":276,"youtubeVideoId":"fI1GrHO3Bpo","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1578/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1578/media"}},"user":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1578/relationships/user","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1578/user"}},"createdAt":"2013-03-15T08:28:53.022Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-19T07:57:56.629Z","content":"The World God Only Knows tells of the wacky adventures of Keima Katsurai, a kid who literally does almost nothing with his free time but play dating\nsims. Because he's so good as dating sims, he refers to himself as the “Capture God,” claiming that he can beat any gal game imaginable. Elsea, a\ndemon from hell, mistakenly thinks that the specialty of the Capture God is to seduce real women, and enlists his help to retrieve lost souls; demons\nthat hide in the hearts of women, and can only be retrieved by filling the emptiness in the woman's heart. Keima never actually \\*wants\\* to help\nretrieve the lost souls, but is forced to due to a contract that he has signed; if does not oblige to the contract, he dies.This all gives an\ninteresting twist to the “Monster of the Week” dynamic, in that instead of having the main character fight monsters every week, the series has him\nseduce women.There's a nice mix of drama and comedy; most of the drama and serious aspects come from the emotional issues that the love interests\nface–whereas most of the comedy comes from the wacky personalities of Keima and Elsee. The transitions from dramatic to comedic scenes can be abrupt,\nbut most of the time it doesn't feel too forced.During a comedic scene, the characters (particularly Keima and Elsee) often switch to a much more\ncartoony art style, which helps to add comedic affect. There's also a lot of shout outs to various media, which will probably warrant a chuckle or\ntwo if you manage to understand any of the references.The two protoganists of Keima and Elsee, although actually quite likable, come off as a bit\none-dimensional. Keima is a genius boy wonder who considers reality “a shitty game,” and Elsee is an adorable demon who screws-up at everything…and\nthere's not really much else to these characters, as there is barely any character development throughout the series. This is justifiable in that the\nanime only covers the first 40 chapters of the manga, which as of this writing is an ongoing series with 174 chapters released. So when watching this\n24 episode series, think of it as the beginning of a larger story than it's own standalone thing.The level of enjoyment watching this sort of depends\non how willing you are to suspend disbelief to the fact that Keima uses his knowledge to win the heart of a woman not once, but multiple times. The\nfact alone that Keima uses his knowledge of dating sims to win the heart of women will probably come as a little implausible. Nonetheless, it's\ninteresting to see how Keima strategize, and to see \\*how\\* he uses his knowledge of gal games.With each story-arc by itself, each of the heroine's\nlove for Keima doesn't really feel forced or unnatural–especially when you consider that these are women who have their emotional weaknesses\namplified by an infesting demon. Each love interest is quite likable, and goes through a fair amount of character development; its somewhat remarkable\nconsidering that none of these characters get more than three episodes of screen time.Overall The World God Only Knows is a fun and enjoyable series,\nalbeit one that might challenge your suspension of disbelief depending on how you look at it (although only a little.)

Taku is fairly well developed, but his harem of women follows well-defined stereotypes for characters:  cute sister, contemplative quiet girl, semi-yandere, childhood friend/girlfriend, warrior chick.  Some of them fall out of their bounds a bit, but not to any extreme level.Overall, I really enjoyed this anime.  I actually finished it in one sitting, which hardly ever happens for me.  I hope you found this useful, and that from this review you can decide whether ChäoS;HEAd is relevant to your interests. </p>","likesCount":12,"progress":null,"rating":18,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1585","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1585"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1585/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1585/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"3676","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/3676/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:56:29.549Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"hokuto-no-ken-raoh-gaiden-ten-no-haoh","synopsis":"In the wastelands following the great nuclear war, a legend grew of a man.  “Hokuto No Ken.”  The Fist of the North Star.

About 4 episodes later I was really glad that I did stick with it. By the end of the season, this\nactually made my favorites list.Ga-Rei -Zero- does an excellent job of character development for Yomi and Kagura. In fact, it does such a good job it\nalmost completely ignores most of the other characters, which was the one thing I wish was better.The artwork in the show is very clean, though dark\n(which was in line with the story so I have no complaints). The fights were dynamic and very well done, though some of the weapons and fighting were\nkind of \"out there.\"The soundtrack was nothing amazing to me, but it did well enough at setting the feeling from what I recall feeling while\nwatching each episode.Lastly, the story. There isn't a whole lot to say about it, because this is simply a precursor to the main storyline that\nexists in the manga. That being said, I thought that it was really very well done, giving us a background on the characters that we would need to know\nand setting up the general premise for the content.So, in a nutshell, I really, really liked this series. It had some cool action, some great\ncharacter development, and didn't try to stretch the content. Ga-Rei -Zero- is possibly the best pre-cursor to an existing storyline that I have\nseen, and one that I would easily recommend to anyone that enjoys this genre of show.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>After watching the first couple of episodes of Ga-Rei -Zero-, I came an inch away from just dropping it altogether, but since the fall season didn't have much else that interested me I stuck with it.  About 4 episodes later I was really glad that I did stick with it.  By the end of the season, this actually made my favorites list.Ga-Rei -Zero- does an excellent job of character development for Yomi and Kagura.  In fact, it does such a good job it almost completely ignores most of the other characters, which was the one thing I wish was better.The artwork in the show is very clean, though dark (which was in line with the story so I have no complaints).  The fights were dynamic and very well done, though some of the weapons and fighting were kind of \"out there.\"The soundtrack was nothing amazing to me, but it did well enough at setting the feeling from what I recall feeling while watching each episode.Lastly, the story.  There isn't a whole lot to say about it, because this is simply a precursor to the main storyline that exists in the manga.  That being said, I thought that it was really very well done, giving us a background on the characters that we would need to know and setting up the general premise for the content.So, in a nutshell, I really, really liked this series.  It had some cool action, some great character development, and didn't try to stretch the content.

From the very first episode, the artwork was astounding in its depth of detail and realism. There were scenes that, as a\nprofessional photographer, I would have been proud to have captured their like in a photo, and it was hard to tell they were not photos!

I happen to like them when they are well done, because they concentrate on things like\ncharacter development and the relationships of the individuals involved and I get caught up with the characters, feeling like they are people that I\nknow. This is where Hanasaku Iroha really drew me in...Characters: Yes, the characters are the real prize here. In particular, the growth of those\ncharacters over the 26 episodes and the realism of the relationships between them. There are one or two \"clunkers\" in the batch, the perverted\nwriter and the strident management consultant who drops English phrases like they are the names of celebrities that she knows personally stand out,\nbut most of the characters are well wrought. The protagonist, Ohana, is a particularly well done character. She grows from a fairly shallow girl with\nunrealistic expectations of life, to a strong young woman who knows where she is going and how far she has yet to go. There is similar development in\nmany other characters, with time spent on each as you get to know and love the lot of them. Sound and Music: Excellent for the most part, the only\ndownside I found was the original ED, which I liked well enough when listening to it, but found it unmemorable in the long run. The various OP, ED,\nand insert songs by Nana.RIPE were well done, some to the point of hummable infectiousness. The incidental music and sound effects were all well done,\nadding emphasis to the story and knowing when to let the natural background noises hold court to emphasis a moment or simply carry the mood.Overall,\nthis is one of my favorite shows. It may fade as time goes by, but fresh off the end of the show, I find it a wonderful series that I will look back\non fondly and purchase on BluRay if it becomes available here. The ending was a marvel for anime, in that it didn't try to magically resolve all of\nthe issues and chose a realistic ending that, while a bit bittersweet, left you feeling like the characters lives were on the track they belonged on\nto get where they want to go. That was really the touchstone of the series. Realism. There were some contrived circumstances and typical plot\nmechanisms in play, but the way the characters interacted and developed had a strong sense of \"rightness\" about it. The characters seemed like real\npeople and interacted in realistic ways that brought them to life. In the end, this sense of familiarity with the characters is what brought me back\nfrom week to week and makes me feel that I will miss them now that I am out of their lives. In fact, the sense that I am out of their lives and not\nthe other way around is the strongest indication of how well the writers did their job.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>I am not going to pretend that this is an unbiased review.

In fact, the sense that I am out of their lives and not the other way around is the strongest indication of how well the writers did their job. </p>","likesCount":8,"progress":null,"rating":20,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1590","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1590"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1590/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1590/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"5507","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/5507/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:24:50.580Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"kore-wa-zombie-desu-ka","synopsis":"Not every zombie is the monstrous, brain-eating type.\nOne night while walking home from the convenience store, regular high school boy Ayumu Aikawa is killed by a serial killer, and is just as suddenly brought back to life by a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe.

Much of the combat animation is choppy and awkward looking, though I will grant that some of this is intentional due to the nature of\nthe zombie protagonist. His body moves in awkward ways at times. The character designs, with the exception of Yuu, are also a bit generic, with Sera\nbeing the only human character that I have not mistaken for someone else at least briefly at some point in the show.

There are\nsome parts that are beautifully done, but others that fall short. The magical transformation sequences are quite striking, in their visual effect and\nthe humor value as well! Another aspect that bothers some, but not me, is the level of fan service and gore. I consider most of the fan service to be\nparody, and it never becomes prurient or of an overtly sexual nature. The gore is also frequently used for comic effect, and the show is, after all,\nabout a zombie! One must anticipate a certain amount of blood and gore!I'm not saying that there aren't some bits of excellence. Where the animators\ntake the time to make the art shine, it is great. I just feel there are too many points at which they let it slide along at average.Music/Sound\nEffects: 8 of 10The opening music is very good and the incidental music is frequently spot on. The end music is a catchy little tune, but also a bit\nannoying, as is the super deformed animation used during it.Voice Acting: 8 of 10The main voice actors are well done, with Haruna and Sera having a\nnice blend of acerbic tone with the occasional softer side. The male lead is well done but nothing really that special either. The best friend\ncharacter's voice I find annoying, but I think you are supposed to. The Megalo tend to all sound alike to me. The \"friend in the hospital\" is one\nof the strongest vocal performances, as that character goes through some pretty impressive changes and variations across the episodes the is featured\nin.

I watch it first of the Monday\nshows that come out on Cruncyroll and will re-watch episodes most weeks.

If you are looking for action, fan service, or comedy, look elsewhere. (There are plenty of options!) For those\nof you familiar with the manga, you might want to know that the story appears to pick up in the middle. The manga starts when they are in 5th grade,\nbut the anime starts on the first day of middle school. A lot of the history that is under the bridge for our two protagonists is presented via\nflashback sequences that bring us up to speed on where the characters have been and how they got where they are today.The biggest knock on the show is\nthat it doesn't really have any plot. It is completely slice-of-life drama. There is not anything to drive the story. It just brings you along to\nwatch as these youngsters learn about themselves and the world around them. In my opinion, that is a minor flaw at best, as the writing and the pacing\nof the show is such that you really get a good emotional feel for the characters, and that is the real payoff in this showAnother possible complaint\nis that it is hard to follow. The show does not stop to explain anything to you about any of the characters, and there are a whole lot of them! (This\ncan also be viewed as a strength, as it shows that the creators have enough respect for the viewer to let them figure out the story on their own\nwithout spoon-feeding it to them. Frankly, too much expository material can ruin slice-of-life stories, as they then turn into lectures and lose the\nnatural feel that makes them enjoyable in the first place.) Frequently, I find myself uncertain of who is who early in an episode, but as the show has\ngone on, that happens less often. And that is a good thing, because the characters are one of the real strengths of the show! They are well-rounded,\nfully vibrant characters with quirks and nuances that make them come to life in your mind. The one thing that might strike some as false is the\nunnatural maturity of some of these middle school age kids, but being the father of a middle school boy who is active in things like scholastic bowl\nand orchestra, I can say that I don't find them that unnaturally mature. (In the event that he reads this review, I have to add that I am, of course,\nreferring to his wonderfully mature friends, not him! LOL! ;)Art: 10 of 10Another strength of the series is the art. Looking like moving watercolor\npaintings, every detail is lovingly drawn to elicit the mood the story requires. The backgrounds and characters are exquisitely done. The only\ncriticism I have is that some of the characters are a bit too similar to each other, but I think that is more of a problem with the lack of\nexplanation of who is who than with the art. After a few episodes, I was able to distinguish the characters well enough, except when you aren't\nsupposed to be able to! (There is a character that appears very differently than they had earlier in one of the episodes, and I think you are supposed\nto be a bit confused until their name is said.)From what I understand, the soft watercolors and washed-out backgrounds emulate the style of the manga,\nwhich has been referred to as \"minimalist\" in its artistic style. That carries through to the anime, with the art having wonderful detail, but no\nmore or less than is absolutely needed. It never feels like there is too much to see to truly appreciate a scene, but at the same time, each scene is\nrich enough to convey its message without the viewer feeling there is anything missing. The emotional impact of the images themselves is considerable.\nThe art is impressive!Music and Sound Effects: 10 of 10The OP for the show (\"Itsudatte.\" by Daisuke) is strong, bringing the viewer into the story\nwith just the right mood, but where the music really shines is the excellent ED (\"For You\" by Rie Fu). The song has the ability to elicit tears all\non its own, with a keen sense of longing and devotion, yet an uplifting and optimistic feeling as the song progresses. The spartan animation,\nconsisting of Shūichi walking along stoically on a blank background, then having his movement become more animated and girlish when the music returns\nto the chorus and the air is filled with cherry blossoms.The music inside the episodes is very understated and well done. It knows when to emphasize\nthe mood and when to remain in the background for support, but it also knows when to go away entirely and let the awkward silence or the natural\nbackground sounds fill the space, cementing the mood in that situation as well.Overall Enjoyment: 10 of 10This is a fantastic show. It is heartfelt\nand warm, with great respect for its characters and the viewers ability to understand the story with minimal expository material. It may not be my\nfavorite of the season, as there are shows that are more \"fun\" in the moment and more stimulating. However, in the long run I expect that it will\nrank among my favorite shows of all time and I will probably buy the BluRay and watch it time and again when I am in the mood for some deep character\ndrama. There are many places to go to get a good romantic comedy or a nice suspenseful action show or even a raunchy, fan service laden ecchi fest.\nThere are very few sources for exquisite art combined with rich character drama and deep emotion, and Wandering Son is one. (OK, any movie by Makoto\nShinkai qualifies, and that is why I ordered the DVD of \"5 Centimeters Per Second\" the other day, but I digress…)\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>[Based on episodes 1-6 of the anime.]Story/Characters: 7/10 of 10If you are in the market for a touching story with a lot of emotion and drama, this could be the show for you this season. If you are looking for action, fan service, or comedy, look elsewhere. (There are plenty of options!) For those of you familiar with the manga, you might want to know that the story appears to pick up in the middle. The manga starts when they are in 5th grade, but the anime starts on the first day of middle school. A lot of the history that is under the bridge for our two protagonists is presented via flashback sequences that bring us up to speed on where the characters have been and how they got where they are today.The biggest knock on the show is that it doesn't really have any plot. It is completely slice-of-life drama. There is not anything to drive the story. It just brings you along to watch as these youngsters learn about themselves and the world around them. In my opinion, that is a minor flaw at best, as the writing and the pacing of the show is such that you really get a good emotional feel for the characters, and that is the real payoff in this showAnother possible complaint is that it is hard to follow. The show does not stop to explain anything to you about any of the characters, and there are a whole lot of them! (This can also be viewed as a strength, as it shows that the creators have enough respect for the viewer to let them figure out the story on their own without spoon-feeding it to them. Frankly, too much expository material can ruin slice-of-life stories, as they then turn into lectures and lose the natural feel that makes them enjoyable in the first place.) Frequently, I find myself uncertain of who is who early in an episode, but as the show has gone on, that happens less often. And that is a good thing, because the characters are one of the real strengths of the show! They are well-rounded, fully vibrant characters with quirks and nuances that make them come to life in your mind.

In many cases it seems that, as a mystery,\nit is a very good character based show with a good amount of humor and action mixed together. The mysteries in the first two arcs are, in general, far\ntoo easy to solve, but the story does pick up the pace after that. I believe that some of this is intentional. In particular, the first mystery is\ndesigned more to show how incompetent Grevil is rather than showing Victorique's brilliance or providing a real mystery for the viewer to sink their\nteeth into. The next few sections of mystery plot seem more intended to display Victorique's genius, as she solves them so quickly that the viewer\ndoesn't really have time to ruminate about them, though they are not too hard to solve anyway. There are several plot points in the Queen Berry arc\nthat were pleasantly surprising, and the tie in they make with real world history were deftly handled. The mood of the show changes decidedly in the\nfinal half, going from more of a light hearted feel with tense moments in the final portions of a story arc to a much more intense and dark tone\nthroughout. The real mystery, we find, is not in the individual story arcs and their petty plot points, but in the overarching story of Victorique’s\norigin, her family, and the intrigues and mechanisms of both the villains and those who seek to help our intrepid heroine and her stalwart protector.\nWill a cruel world tear apart these two youngsters as it appears to be tearing itself apart, or will they persevere and find their way to a happy\nending against all odds? This is where the story truly begins to shine!But the story is not what this show is about! It is about Kujō and Victorique,\ntheir friendship, and the bond of trust and eventually love that develops as the story progresses. Kujō is one of the finest anime leading men to be\npaired with a strong tsundere leading lady in recent memory. Frankly, he is right up there with Ryuji from Toradora and Sousuke from Full Metal Panic.\nHe is strong, loyal, brave, and surprisingly good with a pair of brass knuckles. He is willing to put himself in the path of danger in order to\nprotect Victorique, even when he had just met her. As the story progresses, she begins to rely on him for that physical protection, but even more,\nKujō becomes her emotional rock as well. Victorique is a classic tsundere, wrapped up in goth-loli packaging. But she is more than just a moe\nstereotype. Victorique is a fantastic character, with many sterling features including her demonstrative boredom, her sarcastic monotone laugh, her\nvulnerability because of her diminutive size, and her emotional fragility because of various factors in her childhood. She is a complex and well\nrounded character, capable of a wide range of tsun, from biting sarcasm to bald face manipulation of Kujō's tender-hearted nature, but she also has a\ntender side that is loyal to her Kujō and seems genuinely happy to have someone she can trust in her life. By the end, when the two have fallen in\nlove, the tender moments between them are fantastic and when the hands of fate separate them, the pain is palpable! The way that these two characters\ninteract and develop as the mysteries swirl around them is a joy to behold and one of the main pleasures of this show.Art: 9 of 10The background art\nfor Gosick is stunning! The lush greens of the forested mountainside, the architecture of the school with its towers and old buildings, and the\nwonderful attention to detail in the school environment, as well as the other settings when the two are off campus, are all done with exquisite charm\nand impressive style. The character designs are wonderful, with Victorique's ultra cute, doll like looks and flowing hair and Kujō's attractive yet\ndown to earth everyman look, as well as the other characters in the school and outside of it. The main problems I have with the art do stem from the\ncharacters, however. Grevil's hair is atrocious! It is supposed to be, I realize, but it is beyond silly! The fact that it is an integral plot point\ndoes not excuse it! There is also a tendency to rely on some fairly unattractive and out of place super deformed animation techniques when showing\nsurprise, chagrin, or shock in the characters, though the blushing face of Victorique when embarrassed is one of the true joys of the show. The\nanimation, particularly of the action scenes with Kujō and the various horror/suspense moments in the show is first rate and very smooth. The surreal\nwar scenes of the final arc are almost ‘Madoka’ level in their bizarreness, adding another layer of artistry to the show’s accomplishments. The horror\naspects of the show can get pretty graphic, so be prepared and consider the age of the viewers if you tend to watch anime with your kids. (Eleven or\ntwelve and up should be fine, but if the child is prone to nightmares or squeamish, you might want to wait until 14 or 15.)Music and Sound Effects: 10\nof 10The music for this show is almost always exactly the right mood at the right time with just the right intensity to enhance the story or drive it\nforward. At first, I was unsure about the opening theme, as it seemed a bit too much like something you would hear with an action show like Full Metal\nPanic, but it grows on you with repeated listening and, as my son pointed out, it fits the beginning of the anime in terms of the fact that the\nopening of arcs in the story are generally more light and comedic in nature, while the climax of an arc is bound to be more suspenseful and tense,\nwhich is where the ED music comes in. The end theme, \"Resuscitated Hope,\" is one of the finest anime songs I have ever heard! While in mid arc the\nshow strives to end each episode with a mini-cliff-hanger, edge of your seat, shiver up your spine moment. When it succeeds, that sensation is\namplified by the haunting, driving rhythm and minor key sensibility of this wonderful song! I get chills up my spine just listening to it, without the\nanime lead in! The second ED, “Unity”while not as good of a song as the first, is just as effective in evoking the mood of the show as it turns darker\nand the lives of our duo become more fraught with danger. It is haunting and painfully evocative of Victorique’s tortured past. The animation that\ngoes with it is extremely well done. Both of them bring shivers to my spine! The background and incidental music inside the episodes is expertly done,\nas one should expect of a show with a mystery/horror based theme.Voice Acting: 9 of 10The voice acting for the leads is wonderful, particularly\nVictorique. Her distinctive style of talking and the range of emotions she displays are challenging tasks that are ably met by Aoi Yūki. The\naforementioned monotone laugh and the tone of voice when she is massively embarrassed and about to go into full tsun mode are priceless! Kujō's voice\nactor also does an excellent job, displaying a good range of emotional states and a solid base from which Victorique's eccentricity can be fully\nappreciated. The weak point would have to be Grevil, whose voice is almost as annoying as his hair, but I expect that was intentional on the part of\nthe director.Overall Enjoyment: 10 of 10This show is one of my favorites of all time! I am unapologetically a fan of Gosick and would buy in on BluRay\nin an instant if Bandai had not gone and folded their home video operations after snatching up the rights. I hope that someone rescues the license,\neven if it is NIS America and I have to deal with not having a dubbed version. I just want to have it to watch whenever I wish in a well-minted disk.\nIs that too much to ask? At least it is still on Crunchyroll and I can go there and watch it anytime I please, which I have done with select episodes\na few times since the show ended. If you haven't checked it out, I would suggest that you give Gosick a try!\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Story/Characters: 8/10 of 10The only weakness of this anime, is the plotting of a couple of the story arcs.

Is that too much to ask? At least it is still on Crunchyroll and I can go there and watch it anytime I please, which I have done with select episodes a few times since the show ended. If you haven't checked it out, I would suggest that you give Gosick a try! </p>","likesCount":3,"progress":null,"rating":20,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1593","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1593"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1593/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1593/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"2249","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2249/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:35:20.042Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:23:07.934Z","slug":"school-days","synopsis":"High school student Makoto Itou first notices Kotonoha Katsura at the start of his second semester, freshman year.

I was quite reluctant as the story seemed too iffy when i read the synopsis.\nAnd then, I recommended the anime to my sister, since she is a crazy shoujo anime fan, and decided to overlook the anime myself.\n\nI was just recently having the time of my life, with Hayate, Ippo and Spice and Wolf II all rolling week in week out, until they all ended. I was\nlooking for a replacement but was not sure what to pick. Then I checked my HDD and thought \"okay. there is skip beat! there, I copied from my\nsister's.\" I thought lets see whats so good about it, as my sis has been ruining my life wanting me to see that.\n\nAnd here I am, fell in love with the anime. It actually amazed me to find out later on that the original manga started way back in 2002, and has been\nreally popular ever since and still ongoing.\n\nAnyways, thats me and Skip Beat! Now for the review:\n\nHere is your synopsis. Kyoko (Marina Inoue), an energetic and devoted girl, gave up school and decided to follow her prince-charming Shoutarou 'Sho'\nFuwa (Mamoru Miyano) to Tokyo as Sho has set his dream to become the next big thing of Japan. Yeap. His aim is to become the number one Idol in Japan.\nBut there is this big problem. The current heart-throb of Japanese Entertainment line, Ren Tsuruga (Katsuyuki Konishi). Sho goes out of control\nwhenever there is anything about Ren, and throws his frustration and whatnot to Kyoko. Kyoko, as a result has been hating Ren for ruining her\nlove-life. And she badmouths Ren all the time to show her support for Sho. Kyoko, giving her all to Sho, decided to follow Sho through and through,\nuntil she overheard that Sho thinks lowly of her and the only reason he keeps her around is for household chores. Kyoko's world shatters. She throws\nher hatred to Sho and promises him vengeance, that she will take him on in the very world he wants to rule over, the world of showbiz. \n\nStory: 10/10. One of the most lovable of shoujo stories out there I can tell you. Its right there in the ranks of the best. The story is simple but\npowerful, gives you the \"what will happen next\" and full of unpredictable outcomes that will keep you entangled and without knowing, you'll\ndefinitely get absorbed in no time.\n\nThroughout the entire anime, you'll find the determination and dedication runs through Kyoko and how she without even knowing herself, affects the\npeople surrounding her, the obstacles she is about to overcome to reach her goal, and add to that, doing things which are irregular, if not insane.\n\nAnd of course, there is love to bloom. Kyoko, dejected through Sho, has closed her emotions of love and decides to never fall for anyone again. Ren,\nwhom she has been badmouthing while with her days with Sho, she finds him also cold and lacking heart. But the reason behind Ren's coldness towards\nher, is something she doesn't know. But soon, she finds out that Ren is, deep down is not what she usually thought him to be. Will her heart finally\nskip a beat for the Japan's Number One? Find out yourself!\n\nArt: Okay, I will be honest here. Most of the shoujo anime sucks in drawing when it comes to surroundings. This one isn't an exception either. I hate\nto tell this, but every time I saw Ren's Porsche 911, I really wanted to redraw that. So yes. 5/10 for artwork of the surroundings.\n\nWhat covers up for the lack of details in the surroundings is of course the character drawings. There are lots of lots of chibi scenes, i would say\nevery the other scene is probably drawn with chibi characters, but that goes so well with the mood and makes the anime even more lovable. But the best\npart about the drawing will remain the expressions when the mood is serious or needs attention. The eyes, eyebrows, the lips, the facial shadows\neverything is drawn so lively that you can actually not only feel the emotional state of the character but also the atmosphere around them. 10/10 for\ncharacter drawings, which in whole gets an 8/10 overall.\n\nSound: The BGM and the OP/ED are really superb. The sounds actually help to change the mood and the sounds change often as the animation hovers\nbetween serious expressions and chibi drawings. What makes it even more enjoyable is that the sounds are nicely blended with the screenplay. There was\nnot once I felt that the BGM didn't go with the screenplay. As for the OP/ED, I fell in love with both the ED songs and I am sure anyone will too.\nThe second OP is also very nice. Sound gets a 9/10 from me.\n\nCharacter: This is where the anime is probably reached its best. Kyoko, instead of falling apart, decides to take on Sho from the very instant her\nworld is crushed. Her determination, dedication and ambition mixed with her softness and kindness, make her character one of the best female\ncharacters I have come across so far. Her self-declaration of not falling for anyone ever again, shows only her emotional state and although she\nbelieves her emotion of love is long dead, she does things for others which shows, deep inside, her heart is still capable skipping a beat or two.\nThis is probably Marina's best performance as a seiyuu after Kasahara (Toshokan Sensou). \n\nSho, performed by Mamoru Miyano, is already a legend in seiyuu world (Light Yagami (Death Note), Setsuna F. Seiei (Gundam 00), Tamaki Suou (Ouran Host\nClub), Death The Kid (Soul Eater) and many more). There's nothing much to say about his performance as his character amazingly swindles when he is in\nthe public and when is in private. His shift of voice has always been a class above regular seiyuu and thus making him arguably the best in recent\ntimes. Sho is just another addition to his illustrious seiyuu career. He performed so well, you will definitely hate Sho.\n\nRen Tsuruga, performed by Katsuyuki Konishi, (other major performances: Kamina (TTGL), Komui Lee (D.Gray-man), Haji (Blood+), Tooya (Ayashi no Ceres)\nOzma Lee (Macross Frontier) etc.) has been amazing. Ren doesn't show his true emotion in front of everyone. His true personality remains a mystery to\nKyoko as she can't compare the Ren who can be both cold and warm from time to time. Konishi performed the character as it should be, Ren, the number\none Idol in Japan, who is professional to the last and always puts his works as priority one, shows the reason why he is the most successful man in\nthe world of entertainment. As the anime progresses, Kyoko starts to understand Ren bit by bit, and without knowing herself, starts to admire him as\nher senpai.\n\nAnd the anime character list is rounded up with other interesting characters Kyoko is set to meet as she is about the find out that 'revenge over\nSho' is not the reason anymore as she takes every step to become an actress. 10/10 for characters.\n\nEnjoyment: You bet I want moar! This anime is absolutely a masterpiece of entertainment. Seriously, I can't but have to say I will love to see they\nare making a 3 or 4 seasons of it. For now, I will be hoping that the anime gets a well deserved Season 2. And I will be getting the first release out\nonline, because not having Skip Beat! in my watch list is almost hurting. 10/10 for enjoyment.\n\nOverall: I will rate it 9/10, as a whole. This anime has given me so much entertainment that I can rewatch this anime over and over again and will\nnever, ever get tired of it, that I can assure.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>A couple of my female friends have been pestering me to watch this anime.

Kyoko (Marina Inoue), an energetic and devoted girl, gave up school and decided to follow her prince-charming Shoutarou 'Sho' Fuwa (Mamoru Miyano) to Tokyo as Sho has set his dream to become the next big thing of Japan. Yeap. His aim is to become the number one Idol in Japan. But there is this big problem. The current heart-throb of Japanese Entertainment line, Ren Tsuruga (Katsuyuki Konishi). Sho goes out of control whenever there is anything about Ren, and throws his frustration and whatnot to Kyoko. Kyoko, as a result has been hating Ren for ruining her love-life. And she badmouths Ren all the time to show her support for Sho. Kyoko, giving her all to Sho, decided to follow Sho through and through, until she overheard that Sho thinks lowly of her and the only reason he keeps her around is for household chores. Kyoko's world shatters. She throws her hatred to Sho and promises him vengeance, that she will take him on in the very world he wants to rule over, the world of showbiz. </p><p>Story: 10/10. One of the most lovable of shoujo stories out there I can tell you. Its right there in the ranks of the best. The story is simple but powerful, gives you the \"what will happen next\" and full of unpredictable outcomes that will keep you entangled and without knowing, you'll definitely get absorbed in no time.</p><p>Throughout the entire anime, you'll find the determination and dedication runs through Kyoko and how she without even knowing herself, affects the people surrounding her, the obstacles she is about to overcome to reach her goal, and add to that, doing things which are irregular, if not insane.</p><p>And of course, there is love to bloom. Kyoko, dejected through Sho, has closed her emotions of love and decides to never fall for anyone again. Ren, whom she has been badmouthing while with her days with Sho, she finds him also cold and lacking heart. But the reason behind Ren's coldness towards her, is something she doesn't know. But soon, she finds out that Ren is, deep down is not what she usually thought him to be. Will her heart finally skip a beat for the Japan's Number One? Find out yourself!</p><p>Art: Okay, I will be honest here. Most of the shoujo anime sucks in drawing when it comes to surroundings. This one isn't an exception either. I hate to tell this, but every time I saw Ren's Porsche 911, I really wanted to redraw that. So yes. 5/10 for artwork of the surroundings.</p><p>What covers up for the lack of details in the surroundings is of course the character drawings. There are lots of lots of chibi scenes, i would say every the other scene is probably drawn with chibi characters, but that goes so well with the mood and makes the anime even more lovable. But the best part about the drawing will remain the expressions when the mood is serious or needs attention. The eyes, eyebrows, the lips, the facial shadows everything is drawn so lively that you can actually not only feel the emotional state of the character but also the atmosphere around them. 10/10 for character drawings, which in whole gets an 8/10 overall.</p><p>Sound: The BGM and the OP/ED are really superb. The sounds actually help to change the mood and the sounds change often as the animation hovers between serious expressions and chibi drawings. What makes it even more enjoyable is that the sounds are nicely blended with the screenplay. There was not once I felt that the BGM didn't go with the screenplay. As for the OP/ED, I fell in love with both the ED songs and I am sure anyone will too. The second OP is also very nice. Sound gets a 9/10 from me.</p><p>Character: This is where the anime is probably reached its best. Kyoko, instead of falling apart, decides to take on Sho from the very instant her world is crushed. Her determination, dedication and ambition mixed with her softness and kindness, make her character one of the best female characters I have come across so far. Her self-declaration of not falling for anyone ever again, shows only her emotional state and although she believes her emotion of love is long dead, she does things for others which shows, deep inside, her heart is still capable skipping a beat or two. This is probably Marina's best performance as a seiyuu after Kasahara (Toshokan Sensou). </p><p>Sho, performed by Mamoru Miyano, is already a legend in seiyuu world (Light Yagami (Death Note), Setsuna F. Seiei (Gundam 00), Tamaki Suou (Ouran Host Club), Death The Kid (Soul Eater) and many more). There's nothing much to say about his performance as his character amazingly swindles when he is in the public and when is in private. His shift of voice has always been a class above regular seiyuu and thus making him arguably the best in recent times. Sho is just another addition to his illustrious seiyuu career. He performed so well, you will definitely hate Sho.</p><p>Ren Tsuruga, performed by Katsuyuki Konishi, (other major performances: Kamina (TTGL), Komui Lee (D.Gray-man), Haji (Blood+), Tooya (Ayashi no Ceres) Ozma Lee (Macross Frontier) etc.) has been amazing. Ren doesn't show his true emotion in front of everyone. His true personality remains a mystery to Kyoko as she can't compare the Ren who can be both cold and warm from time to time. Konishi performed the character as it should be, Ren, the number one Idol in Japan, who is professional to the last and always puts his works as priority one, shows the reason why he is the most successful man in the world of entertainment. As the anime progresses, Kyoko starts to understand Ren bit by bit, and without knowing herself, starts to admire him as her senpai.</p><p>And the anime character list is rounded up with other interesting characters Kyoko is set to meet as she is about the find out that 'revenge over Sho' is not the reason anymore as she takes every step to become an actress. 10/10 for characters.</p><p>Enjoyment: You bet I want moar! This anime is absolutely a masterpiece of entertainment. Seriously, I can't but have to say I will love to see they are making a 3 or 4 seasons of it. For now, I will be hoping that the anime gets a well deserved Season 2. And I will be getting the first release out online, because not having Skip Beat! in my watch list is almost hurting. 10/10 for enjoyment.</p><p>Overall: I will rate it 9/10, as a whole. This anime has given me so much entertainment that I can rewatch this anime over and over again and will never, ever get tired of it, that I can assure.</p>","likesCount":1,"progress":null,"rating":18,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false}],"meta":{"count":13187},"links":{"first":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=0","prev":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=20","next":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=60","last":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=13167"},"headers":{"date":"Mon, 06 Jun 2022 07:15:56 GMT","content-type":"application/vnd.api+json","transfer-encoding":"chunked","connection":"close","x-frame-options":"SAMEORIGIN","x-xss-protection":"1; mode=block","x-content-type-options":"nosniff","x-download-options":"noopen","x-permitted-cross-domain-policies":"none","referrer-policy":"strict-origin-when-cross-origin","vary":"Accept, Origin","etag":"W/\"9ce171be7a291c528ad1fc226ad7ce47\"","cache-control":"max-age=0, private, must-revalidate","x-request-id":"63e70cb0-91c2-4c13-afa1-18e0d8f0fe1a","x-runtime":"0.394292","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; preload","cf-cache-status":"DYNAMIC","expect-ct":"max-age=604800, report-uri=\"https://report-uri.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/beacon/expect-ct\"","report-to":"{\"endpoints\":[{\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\/report\\/v3?s=gSbD6IcTSyfEE49nMjYnQJpTLiHtvrNQ7Cw3NnXZCH9l9CvfNXEMI0eQiNQm3hnHPsVwOE85MSYrPe88WcJjvtZErrR15jcdoYUf9P4Jw8sAvgZrJLjQt%2Fvflw%3D%3D\"}],\"group\":\"cf-nel\",\"max_age\":604800}","nel":"{\"success_fraction\":0,\"report_to\":\"cf-nel\",\"max_age\":604800}","server":"cloudflare","cf-ray":"716f5c128b23777f-LHR","alt-svc":"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400, h3-29=\":443\"; ma=86400"}},{"data":[{"id":"1595","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1595"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1595/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1595/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"15","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/15/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:28.575Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:23:21.343Z","slug":"school-rumble","synopsis":"Just the words \"I love you,\" and everything changes—such is the nature of the bittersweet trials of high school romance.

When you hear the words\ntriangles, music, missiles, more music and even more missiles, what is it that you think of? Most well-versed anime viewers should be thinking of the\nMacross franchise, as this can effectively sum up a great portion of what it's all about, ranging from the original series to the latest installment\nentitled Frontier.Macross Frontier happens to be a fairly ordinary anime that in its simplicity, loses direction as it progresses, only to attempt to\nget back on track after wasting lots of time. When you break it down, at least half of the episodes are fillers, and a majority of the rest are short\narcs that don't really connect and flow together to form a solid plot like any good series would. Since this is not an episodic series, this format\nbegins to hurt itself in the long run, as only little bits of crucial information about the grand scheme of things are revealed throughout the series.\nThis makes the progression of the main plot very slow and unnecessarily dragged out. It's not until the final third of the series that it decides to\nfocus on what can be considered the main plot. Up until this point, the plot was nothing more than a simple \"Defend the human race from unknown\naliens\", which is already weak in and of itself as it's really just a poor excuse for some mecha action, but it decided to take a sharp 180 and go\ndown the oh so wonderful conspiracy route. With this development that couldn't help but be expected many episodes prior, everything starts to become\na giant mess. This was hinted to a few times throughout the beginning of the series, usually only for a very short time period in select episodes\ndisplaying things like undercover discussions or trades, so it's not like it came on unforeseen by the audience. If anything, it happened far too\nlate, as the motives behind Grace and Leon who were originally working together are hardly delved into, and they simply play the bad-guy role because\nthe series needed a better antagonist than random aliens. Both individuals having very grandiose goals of wanting to rule the universe, you can't\nhelp but wonder how they actually planned on executing this in the first place. It is only explained after Grace O'Connor, the great evil mastermind\nbehind everything, had her plans proceed to completion without any hitch at all. Now, having full control over the Vajra, it's pretty safe to say she\nholds much more power than anyone else currently, yet, of course, is defeated by the power of... music (Catchy j-pop music at that). A lot of build up\nwas wasted in favor of going this predictable route, and it is basically the equivalent of beating the bad guy through the power of friendship. At the\nvery least, they tried to give some basis for this being possible with information from earlier episodes explaining the power of music within the\nMacross universe. Seeing as this all happened in the span of a few episodes, it's safe to say that pacing became a huge issue, and solidified the\nfact that most of the other episodes were nothing more than \"filler\" and short arcs. They could have used this time to begin to develop the plot,\nbut that wasn't the case. They may as well have cut out these episodes in favor of getting straight to the point, rather than extending the series\nunnecessarily. With the remaining episodes not being devoted to plot advancement, some character development should be expected in them, however,\nit's nowhere near as much as there should have been for how much time was devoted to this aspect. A majority of the remaining episodes used most of\ntheir time focused on the love triangle between the three main characters, but the events and developments that took place were usually undermined due\nto the indecisive and undeveloped protagonist of the series, Alto Saotome. He is also better known by some of the characters as Princess Alto, and for\ngood reason. And while it may not all necessarily be because of him, he is directly involved in many of the simple plot conveniences used to keep the\nlove triangle from moving forward. Whether it be going out to fight against the Vajra during a crucial time when he was supposed to be with Ranka, or\nRanka seeing him with Sheryl and then wallowing in her own sadness about it afterwards. However, with Alto being the resident princess of the series,\nit's not a far stretch to say he certainly can act like one at times. Ranging from his daddy issues leading to him running away from home to become a\npilot, or how he likes to ignore any real problems that he faces, there's almost nothing about him that doesn't scream \"Princess\". He even has\ngorgeous flowing locks of hair to accentuate this. In fact, I have no doubt that some would start to question his manhood, as he practically ignores\nany advances from both Sheryl and Ranka, which goes back to him being largely at fault for the triangle never progressing. Any time it seems like\nhe's made up his mind about who he wants to be with, the next episode has some bad news for you, as he basically does the equivalent of saying \"Just\nkidding!\", and begins to show what can be considered interest in the opposite girl. As for the whole \"Princess\" nickname and his daddy issues, they\nare touched on briefly, but it comes off as nothing more than the writers quickly throwing together some semblance of a back story so that they could\npass him off as more than your average self-insert main character. Having Alto bounce back and forth between who it seemed he was interested in\nclearly shows which characters are supposed to be the selling point of the series, and of course, I can only be talking about Ranka and Sheryl. Long\nwinded fan boy name calling and debates aside for now, they both have their ups and downs as characters.Ranka, who is easily the character who\nreceives the most focus in the series, happens to be the one who receives the least development for all the time she spent on screen (Go figure). She\nmanages to slowly get over her timid nature when it comes to singing, but only because of the encouragement Alto gives her throughout the series.\nAlthough this was good however, even with her having the most interaction with other characters and general screen time, she never developed a reason\nfor singing past doing it for Alto's affection. Due to the fact that the time spent on her was poorly utilized, her development was hindered in the\nlong run. This is made especially apparent when you see that a few of the side characters have more motivation for their actions than she does. For\nthe sheer amount of focus the series gave her character, seeing them do nothing with it past the first few episodes was disappointing to say the\nleast. Sheryl, on the other hand, plays a much more interesting role in the series. Many pass her off as \"Bitchy\", \"Overly arrogant\" and many\nother demeaning terms from the moment she appears on screen, but she manages to easily become the best character in the cast. With her status\nestablished right from the beginning, it's not unfitting for her to act much like she runs the place. Providing a stark contrast from Ranka, Sheryl\nis confident and domineering to an extent, yet still caring of others, shown by her attitude towards Ranka and Alto. She eventually softens up a bit,\nmostly due to her feelings for Alto since he doesn't worship her like everyone else in the colonies. The struggle she goes through while falling from\nthe top as Ranka took over is far more believable than anything Ranka or Alto went through. Having to cope with her fall from stardom, as well as her\nimpending death due to a disease, she accepts these facts and still tries to move forward, doing the only thing she can do: sing. This made her far\nmore endearing to the audience by the end of the series, as this shows her confidence wasn't simply based on her status as the Galactic Fairy, but\nher strength of will that was built up through living her old lifestyle of complete poverty. While she did remain mostly static, what she went through\ndidn't feel contrived, much like the case was with Ranka. But of course, like many other series, one of the biggest problems Macross Frontier\npresents is the ending. Again, I find myself questioning Alto's sexuality, as the ending provides zero closure for what is considered the main focus\nof the series: the love triangle between the three main characters. This is Macross, the plot is only there to help move the romance forward, and\nthat's one thing Frontier severely failed at. Not only was Alto himself preventing it from taking a big step forward with his indecisiveness and\nconstant character changes, the sheer amount of conveniences that kept the character's relationships from developing sure didn't help either. Like I\nmentioned, the filler episodes would mostly focus on the love triangle, but focusing on it is not the same as actually having it progress. Regardless\nof how much it actually progressed by the end, a conclusion is needed, and that's something the series never provided. While it was very heavily\nsuggested that Sheryl \"won\" before the finale, the final moments of the series throw the entirety of the few episodes Alto was together with Sheryl\nright out the window, and has Ranka enter the competition once more. As we all know, Alto has a major fascination for the sky, more so than for the\ntwo girls who fawned over him for the entire series. So what does he do? He doesn't clearly choose either girl, but instead chooses the mother\nfucking sky. Whether it was intentionally done this way so that the Sheryl and Ranka factions wouldn't destroy the world due to a simultaneous\noutburst of angry fan boys crying over the fact that their waifu \"lost\", or because they wanted to leave it up for interpretation, it doesn't\nchange the fact that giving no closure severely impacts the series in a bad way. And when one of the main selling points of the Macross franchise is\nleft untouched, it leaves nothing more than disappointment in the eyes of fans and newcomers alike. While making no decision on which girl the main\ncharacter wants to be with may be a common occurrence in most harem series, it should not be the case when there is only a love triangle at hand. When\nample time is given to devote to two characters and their interactions with the main character, going down this route is nothing more than a bad\ndecision as it should be nearly impossible to get fans to feel satisfied with this kind of ending. It was a shame to see them use this kind of cheap\nexit strategy after putting forth the effort to develop the relationships in the series. After all of this, there's nothing left but disappointment\nin the series. There may have been good j-pop, great action scenes, as well as throwbacks to previous entries in the franchise ranging from songs, to\nname drops and simple phrases, but that only adds to the enjoyment factor. And as most intelligent people will know, even that isn't enough to save a\nseries which continually makes mistakes along the way. At the end of the day, Macross Frontier had a lot of potential, but unfortunately it was ruined\nby Alto who could not manage to keep the series flying smoothly.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Most series can be summed up in a few words, and regardless of their implications, some descriptions may throw you for a loop. When you hear the words triangles, music, missiles, more music and even more missiles, what is it that you think of? Most well-versed anime viewers should be thinking of the Macross franchise, as this can effectively sum up a great portion of what it's all about, ranging from the original series to the latest installment entitled Frontier.Macross Frontier happens to be a fairly ordinary anime that in its simplicity, loses  direction as it progresses, only to attempt to get back on track after wasting lots of time. When you break it down, at least half of the episodes are fillers, and a majority of the rest are short arcs that don't really connect  and flow together to form a solid plot like any good series would. Since this is not an episodic series,  this format begins to hurt itself in the long run, as only little bits of crucial information about the grand scheme of things are revealed throughout the series.  This makes the progression of the main plot very slow and unnecessarily dragged out. It's not until the final third of the series that it decides to focus on what can be considered the main plot. Up until this point, the plot was nothing more than a simple \"Defend the human race from unknown aliens\", which is already weak in and of itself as it's really just a poor excuse for some mecha action, but it decided to take a sharp 180 and go down the oh so wonderful conspiracy route. With this development that couldn't help but be expected many episodes  prior, everything starts to become a giant mess. This was hinted to a few times throughout the beginning of the series, usually only for a very short time period in select episodes displaying things like undercover discussions or trades, so it's not like it came on unforeseen by the audience. If anything, it happened far too late, as the motives behind Grace and Leon who were originally working together are hardly delved into, and they simply play the bad-guy role because the series needed a better antagonist than random aliens. Both individuals having very grandiose goals of wanting to rule the universe, you can't help but wonder how they actually planned on executing this in the first place. It is only explained after Grace O'Connor, the great evil mastermind behind everything, had her plans proceed to completion without any hitch at all. Now, having full control over the Vajra, it's pretty safe to say she holds much more power than anyone else currently, yet, of course, is defeated by the power of... music (Catchy j-pop music at that). A lot of build up was wasted in favor of going this predictable route, and it is basically the equivalent of beating the bad guy through the power of friendship. At the very least, they tried to give some basis for this being possible with information from earlier episodes explaining the power of music within the Macross universe. Seeing as this all happened in the span of a few episodes, it's safe to say that pacing became a huge issue, and solidified the fact that most of the other episodes were nothing more than \"filler\" and short arcs. They could have used this time to begin to develop the plot, but that wasn't the case. They may as well have cut out these episodes in favor of getting straight to the point, rather than extending the series unnecessarily. With the remaining episodes  not being devoted to plot advancement, some character development should  be expected in them, however, it's nowhere near as much as there should have been for how much time was devoted to this aspect. A majority of the remaining episodes used most of their time focused on the love triangle between the three main characters, but the events and developments that took place were usually undermined due to the indecisive and undeveloped protagonist of the series, Alto Saotome. He is also better known by some of the characters as Princess Alto, and for good reason. And while it may not all necessarily be because of him, he is directly involved in many of the simple plot conveniences used to keep the love triangle from moving forward. Whether it be going out to fight against the Vajra during a crucial time when he was supposed to be with Ranka, or Ranka seeing him with Sheryl and then wallowing in her own sadness about it afterwards.  However, with Alto being the resident princess of the series, it's not a far stretch to say he certainly can act like one at times. Ranging from his daddy issues leading to him running away from home to become a pilot, or how he likes to ignore any real problems that he faces, there's almost nothing about him that doesn't scream \"Princess\". He even has gorgeous flowing locks of hair to accentuate this. In fact, I have no doubt that some would start to question his manhood, as he practically ignores any advances from both Sheryl and Ranka, which goes back to him being largely at fault for the triangle never progressing. Any time it seems like he's made up his mind about who he wants to be with, the next episode has some bad news for you, as he basically does the equivalent of saying \"Just kidding!\", and begins to show what can be considered interest in the opposite girl.

A fatal flaw arises right from the beginning, as each person has their own definition of\nhorror depending on how imaginative they might be. While some may immediately think of a bunch of gruesome killings, others may think of more eerie\nsupernatural events, and the list goes on, but because of this, the genre has a high chance of failure depending on each person's perception of\nhorror.Unfortunately, Another just happens to fall way outside my definition of horror, and seems to fit very nicely within comedy.But hold on a\nsecond, this anime isn't just a horror, it's also supposed to be a mystery as well. Every year we're usually greeted with at least one mystery\nanime per season that I only consider mystery simply because that's what they are labeled. This is because, more often than not, anime that are\nsupposed to be predominantly mystery, surprise, have no mystery to speak of in them, and Another is no different.Alright, well, saying there is\nabsolutely no mystery might be a bit of an exaggeration, but can you really consider Another a mystery? When you get down to it, it was ultimately\nabout finding out who the \"Another\" was so that they may be able to stop the curse that has been running rampant for 26 years. The problem with this\nis that for the first four episodes, it was all about Kouichi figuring out who Mei was, seeing as she had the same name as the girl who died 26 years\nago, which is what people believe started the curse in the first place. So when we figure out that she is just a normal girl, everything up until this\npoint felt like nothing more than another useless time sink.Here is where it gets into episodes that are completely wasted in favor of cheap shock\nvalue to try and keep the viewer hooked. Until episode 10, what did they actually learn about the Another? Nothing of any value. Where's the mystery\nin that? I don't find random deaths to be mysterious or horrifying in any way, and this is what the series focused on the entire time. One could\nargue that this narrowed down the possible suspects, but the characters did nothing with this. Even though they might have not been able to do\nanything to stop the curse, they could've at least devoted more time to actually trying to figure out who the Another is rather than waste time with\nother daily activities.Throughout the entire series, there were only two episodes that truly served any purpose, one of which was the beach episode.\nNow, where would any anime be without a beach episode? It's practically mandatory these days, however, it wouldn't be Another without a token death\nscene in almost every episode now would it? The only good thing this episode did was provide us with one of the bigger clues, which made it very easy\nto figure out who the Another might be, as it proved that deaths could happen outside of Yomiyama. Meaning that the Another had to be on the trip. The\nonly problem is that the explanation they gave in the next episode made any speculation as to who the Another was entirely useless. It was said that\nthe person who died actually had gotten a brain injury while still in Yomiyama, and would've died later that day regardless of him being run over and\ntorn to shreds by a boat on the beach. With this, it was practically back to square one since you wouldn't know whether or not the information given\ncould be trusted or not. Although, any good mystery relies on misdirection, and this is one thing I can credit Another for at times, as it did try to\nsend you down a wrong path or two as the series progressed, but this small aspect alone doesn't make up for how horribly executed everything else\nwas.The only other episode that had any purpose was episode 9, and regardless of it being the most frustrating one, it did provide some crucial\ninformation. As the events played out, Kouichi and his band of half-wits found a tape telling them how to stop the curse from continuing. Now, here\ncomes the frustrating part, one of the geniuses amongst the group had the brilliant idea of ripping the tape out of the tape player to stop it from\nplaying, instead of simply pressing the pause or stop button. You seriously have to invent an entirely new level of imbecile to describe something so\nmoronic. Considering the current standards for incompetence in modern society have set the bar so ludicrously low, this newly discovered form of\nstupidity deserves some kind of fucking award. The author clearly was looking for an easy out so that they could extend the series just a bit longer,\nwhich resulted in the wonder that is the final two episodes.However, there was one thing that was the ultimate \"Fuck you\" to all of the viewers.\nMore so than the whole tape fiasco in episode nine, and that's Misaki Mei. Not only did they try to make her seem far more important than she was for\nthe first half of the series, but, in one of the worst reveals I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing, they confirm that she was able to tell\nwho the Another was from the very beginning. So with this, anything of relevance that happened in all of the previous episodes was for naught, and\nthat's just absurd. She could have at least tried to speak out and tell the other students that she knew who the Another was, and before you say they\nwouldn't believe her, take a second to think about this. All of these morons in Class 3 believed in a completely nonsensical curse that was nothing\nmore than superstition until it was proven to be true in the final episode. Yes, nothing could've been done regardless if she told someone or not,\nbut due to the fact that she actually knew the entire time, the mystery was already technically solved since the beginning. It was only a matter of\nfiguring out how to get rid of the Another, which took seven episodes of cheap deaths, one episode to figure out how to stop the curse, one episode of\nhalf the class dying and/or killing each other, and half of the final episode to reveal and kill the Another.Am I the only one who sees a problem\nhere? There was no actual deducting or piecing together of the puzzle. All Mei had to do was convince Kouichi that his aunt was the Another (which\nwent over far too easily by the way), and it was over. I'm not saying that all the deaths could've been avoided, but I'll be damned if Mei isn't\npartially to blame for sitting around doing all of nothing for the previous eleven episodes. This is in no way a mystery. The beginning of the series\ncould be considered an infinitely better mystery than the latter half, as you really have no idea who or what Mei is and what role she actually plays\nin the story until half way through the fifth episode. Not only was the \"mystery\" handled very haphazardly throughout, but the horror and\nsupernatural aspects were as well. Even now, this series isn't listed under supernatural, most likely because horror usually blends with supernatural\nin some way, but knowing that this series has supernatural elements only makes everything far worse. From the beginning, we're introduced to the\ncentral plot point: the curse that started 26 years ago that still takes the lives of people today. The problem with this is that throughout the\nseries, the curse felt like nothing more than superstition. Almost every single death throughout the bulk of the series, and especially the ones in\nepisode eleven could be logically explained in some way rather than only explainable by taking supernatural elements into consideration. There was\nonly one death that truly felt so farfetched that it could only seem like the work of the supernatural hand , and that was the elevator death in\nepisode four. However, no matter how small the chance of it happening is, it was still within the realm of possibility. I understand that hospital\nelevator cables snapping may seem ridiculous, and it really is, but you can't rule out this having happened at least once in documented history. As\nfor the rest of the deaths, they're all easily explained. The umbrella death in episode three? Dying by falling down a flight stairs is entirely\npossible on its own, but regardless of this being in the original source or something P.A. Works changed, Dead Girl #1 falling on the umbrella was\npurely done for trying to hook the audience, and there is no easier way of doing that than making some over-the-top death scene which all the mindless\nlittle sheep will endlessly ejaculate over. Episode five? Heart attack. If I honestly have to explain this one, I'll probably lose what little hope I\nhave left in humanity. Episode seven? Simple suicide. The real question here is why did the teacher who commited suicide have to make such a spectacle\nof his death? Here's a hint: shock value.And they aren't don't yet, oh no. Not only were most of the deaths earlier on in the series blown way out\nof proportion, P.A. Works felt the need to try and make episode eleven able to rival the entirety of a series like Higurashi in terms of deaths and\noverblown character reactions. So here we have a bunch of teenagers scared for their life each and every day, wondering if they'll be the next ones\nto die, and through the magic that is the adolescent mind, one of the previously mentioned half-wits lets two unstable girls listen to the tape so\nthat they may also learn the marvelous way of how to stop the curse. Queue a ridiculous amount of jumping around between scenes that would make even\nShinbo jealous of their artistic direction. To say this episode was shizophrenic would be quite the compliment. Even though there may seem to be a lot\ngoing on in this episode, there is absolutely nothing to it in the end. It's just a meaningless massacre where everyone is dying from a series of\nrandom events like having a pillar falling on top of them, being incinerated by flames or simply being killed by one other in some twisted way due to\nmass hysteria, paranoia and/or plain idiocy. This all goes right back to Mei, as this entire thing could've been avoided if she had spoken up sooner\nabout who the Another is, instead of letting the entirety of Class 3 believe it was her. Even once she revealed to Kouichi that she in fact knew who\nthe Another was (we heard this twice), Kouichi never bothered to ask her who it was the entire time before or after they were being hunted by everyone\nelse in the mansion and Mei never brought it up again. Not only was there no real mystery to begin with, withholding the information that could've\neasily solved this \"mystery\" a couple episodes ago puts her at fault for just about everything. Not the Another.Either way, no matter how you look\nat it, every single death in this series was very highly dramatized to the point of absurdity for the simple sake of selling Blu-Rays. People like\nnonsensical violence, that's just how it is. Many series have success through using shock value (Madoka, for example), so I can't necessarily blame\nP.A. Works for this, as they were just trying to make money like everyone else in the world, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it was all\ncompletely superficial with no deeper meaning other than people dying for the sake of dying. If I wanted to see that, I would just turn on the\nnews.So, what exactly was Kouichi's role in all of this? Being the protagonist of the series, one would imagine that he would be the one solving the\nmystery by piecing together the puzzle; yet he's just as useless as the rest of the cast. His purpose was finished once he figured out the story of\nMei and why she was being ignored by their class in the first place. After this, he, just like everyone else, was tagging along for the ride until the\nconclusion finally came around. Did he piece together evidence based on everything he's heard and encountered to come to the conclusion that the\nAnother was his aunt? No, that was Mei. The only purpose he served in the end was providing us with irrefutable proof that his aunt was the Another by\nrecalling memories that even he forgot until Mei spoke with him about it during the final episode. While this wasn't necessarily bad, as he does get\npoints for not being a beta protagonist like you would imagine him to be, it certainly wasn't good.Now, assuming you're not counting the death\nfodders that people like to call characters, by simple process of elimination, Mei is the only character left to go over, and she is by far the worst\ncharacter in this series. Random Dead Kid #92 was more memorable and even had better characterization and development than she ever had. There was no\nreal depth to her character, and unlike Kouichi, she served no purpose other than actually causing more problems for everyone around her, making her\nmore of an antagonizing force than the Another was. Add in the fact that if she didn't have something unique to her design, she's completely\nindicernable among the myriads of Ayanami Rei clones out there. So what, she has a sad past, but who hasn't gone through something like losing a\nloved one nowadays? It could've been much worse, and I actually expected it to be seeing as just about everything else was expanded upon so\nridiculously in this series. The only ounce of development that actually she received was during the mid-point of the series, which is arguably the\nonly decent portion of it, and that's just because you finally learn about her as more than \"The bitch that no ones gives two fucks about.\"However,\namong the countless death fodders and pitiful excuses for characters, there is one who stands among the rest, simply for being one of the ones I hate\nto see the most in any given work: and that's the catalyst for an overdramatized event. In the case of Another, it would be the woman who owned the\nmansion that Class 3 went to on their trip. She had all of maybe 3 lines the entire time she was on screen, and was viewed as a side character of no\nimportance, yet, out of nowhere, she decided to go on a random killing spree. This came on suddenly and was completely unwarranted, which just\ndetracted from the main focus of the finale. During the final episode, they did decide to leave us with one terrible justification for her actions:\nshe was said to be emotionally unstable due to the death of her grandson, but this should in no way trigger her actions seeing as his death happened\nearlier in the series, and by the fact that she went on the murdering spree BEFORE the news was leaked about Mei presumably being the Another. She\nmerely served as a catalyst to help drive home the paranoia in the already unstable kids staying at the mansion, thus triggering a few of them going\nbatshit insane after they found out that Mei was believed to be the Another. I don't even consider the old woman to be a character, but a horribly\nwritten plot device that was bad enough to actually be addressed.One of the biggest problems with this series is, of course, the ending. Stating the\nobvious, they need to kill the Another so that the curse will be stopped. The only problem with this is that, while the curse is stopped for this\nyear, each person whose life was taken by the curse has a chance to be brought back to life the next year. So, in the end, killing the Another does\nnothing for anyone in the future, only for the present year. Not only is the curse absolutely ridiculous, it adds on yet another layer of absurdity to\neverything by giving a nonsensical reason for how it started and why it continues today. Said given explanation is that 26 years ago, the people of\nClass 3 decided to believe that their classmate who had recently died, wasn't actually dead. Due to this, the curse continued to run rampant each\nyear simply because it could, and it can never be stopped. In the end, the supernatural aspect is nothing more than a terrible excuse to shovel\ngarbage down the throats of the people who eat up pointless deaths. And that is not how horror should work.If there is any credit I can truly give to\nAnother, it's the simple attention to detail that's present in things like the background, exemplary of almost every P.A. works anime. Sadly, this\nis quite easily the strongest point of this series. The atmosphere was great at times, yet seemingly over done at others. The main problem with this\nis that an anime can't be successful with only a few parts out of the many that make it up, especially not something like the atmosphere which\nrequires other aspects of the series to be good in such a manner that it enhances the experience. More often than not, the atmosphere was ruined not\nbecause it was actually overdone, but because the scene taking place was horribly executed. In turn this made everything that took place work against\nany positive aspect the atmosphere might have provided. In combination with the overbearing OST that sounded like an angsty teenager turning their\nstereo up to over 9000 in some apparent misguided sense of rebellion against society; it more than kills any good mood that a scene might have been\ngiving off in record time.At this point, I think it might be P.A. Works who is cursed. Every anime they've produced has had a strong beginning, a\ncore that gets progressively weaker and ultimately yields a poor conclusion. This trend hasn't changed through any of their work, and Another is no\ndifferent. It had the potential to be a good mystery, but started to focus on all the wrong aspects as it progressed, and became nothing more than\nanother twelve weeks of my life wasted.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>When it comes to anime, the horror genre is a tricky one. A fatal flaw arises right from the beginning, as each person has their own definition of horror depending on how imaginative they might be. While some may immediately think of a bunch of gruesome killings, others may think of more eerie supernatural events, and the list goes on, but because of this, the genre has a high chance of failure depending on each person's perception of horror.Unfortunately, Another just happens to fall way outside my definition of horror, and seems to fit very nicely within comedy.But hold on a second, this anime isn't just a horror, it's also supposed to be a mystery as well. Every year we're usually greeted with at least one mystery anime per season that I only consider mystery simply because that's what they are labeled. This is because, more often than not, anime that are supposed to be predominantly mystery, surprise, have no mystery to speak of in them, and Another is no different.Alright, well, saying there is absolutely no mystery might be a bit of an exaggeration, but can you really consider Another a mystery? When you get down to it, it was ultimately about finding out who the \"Another\" was so that they may be able to stop the curse that has been running rampant for 26 years. The problem with this is that for the first four episodes, it was all about Kouichi figuring out who Mei was, seeing as she had the same name as the girl who died 26 years ago, which is what people believe started the curse in the first place. So when we figure out that she is just a normal girl, everything up until this point felt like nothing more than another useless time sink.Here is where it gets into episodes that are completely wasted in favor of cheap shock value to try and keep the viewer hooked. Until episode 10, what did they actually learn about the Another? Nothing of any value. Where's the mystery in that? I don't find random deaths to be mysterious or horrifying in any way, and this is what the series focused on the entire time. One could argue that this narrowed down the possible suspects, but the characters did nothing with this. Even though they might have not been able to do anything to stop the curse, they could've at least devoted more time to actually trying to figure out who the Another is rather than waste time with other daily activities.Throughout the entire series, there were only two episodes that truly served any purpose, one of which was the beach episode. Now, where would any anime be without a beach episode? It's practically mandatory these days, however, it wouldn't be Another without a token death scene in almost every episode now would it? The only good thing this episode did was provide us with one of the bigger clues, which made it very easy to figure out who the Another might be, as it proved that deaths could happen outside of Yomiyama. Meaning that the Another had to be on the trip. The only problem is that the explanation they gave in the next episode made any speculation as to who the Another was entirely useless. It was said that the person who died actually had gotten a brain injury while still in Yomiyama, and would've died later that day regardless of him being run over and torn to shreds by a boat on the beach. With this, it was practically back to square one since you wouldn't know whether or not the information given could be trusted or not. Although, any good mystery relies on misdirection, and this is one thing I can credit Another for at times, as it did try to send you down a wrong path or two as the series progressed, but this small aspect alone doesn't make up for how horribly executed everything else was.The only other episode that had any purpose was episode 9, and regardless of it being the most frustrating one, it did provide some crucial information. As the events played out, Kouichi and his band of half-wits found a tape telling them how to stop the curse from continuing. Now, here comes the frustrating part, one of the geniuses amongst the group had the brilliant idea of ripping the tape out of the tape player to stop it from playing, instead of simply pressing the pause or stop button. You seriously have to invent an entirely new level of imbecile to describe something so moronic. Considering the current standards for incompetence in modern society have set the bar so ludicrously low, this newly discovered form of stupidity deserves some kind of fucking award. The author clearly was looking for an easy out so that they could extend the series just a bit longer, which resulted in the wonder that is the final two episodes.However, there was one thing that was the ultimate \"Fuck you\" to all of the viewers. More so than the whole tape fiasco in episode nine, and that's Misaki Mei. Not only did they try to make her seem far more important than she was for the first half of the series, but, in one of the worst reveals I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing, they confirm that she was able to tell who the Another was from the very beginning. So with this, anything of relevance that happened in all of the previous episodes was for naught, and that's just absurd. She could have at least tried to speak out and tell the other students that she knew who the Another was, and before you say they wouldn't believe her, take a second to think about this. All of these morons in Class 3 believed in a completely nonsensical curse that was nothing more than superstition until it was proven to be true in the final episode. Yes, nothing could've been done regardless if she told someone or not, but due to the fact that she actually knew the entire time, the mystery was already technically solved since the beginning. It was only a matter of figuring out how to get rid of the Another, which took seven episodes of cheap deaths, one episode to figure out how to stop the curse, one episode of half the class dying and/or killing each other, and half of the final episode to reveal and kill the Another.Am I the only one who sees a problem here? There was no actual deducting or piecing together of the puzzle. All Mei had to do was convince Kouichi that his aunt was the Another (which went over far too easily by the way), and it was over. I'm not saying that all the deaths could've been avoided, but I'll be damned if Mei isn't partially to blame for sitting around doing all of nothing for the previous eleven episodes. This is in no way a mystery. The beginning of the series could be considered an infinitely better mystery than the latter half, as you really have no idea who or what Mei is and what role she actually plays in the story until half way through the fifth episode. Not only was the \"mystery\" handled very haphazardly throughout, but the horror and supernatural aspects were as well. Even now, this series isn't listed under supernatural, most likely because horror usually blends with supernatural in some way, but knowing that this series has supernatural elements only makes everything far worse. From the beginning, we're introduced to the central plot point: the curse that started 26 years ago that still takes the lives of people today. The problem with this is that throughout the series, the curse felt like nothing more than superstition. Almost every single death throughout the bulk of the series, and especially the ones in episode eleven could be logically explained in some way rather than only explainable by taking supernatural elements into consideration. There was only one death that truly felt so farfetched that it could only seem like the work of the supernatural hand , and that was the elevator death in episode four. However, no matter how small the chance of it happening is, it was still within the realm of possibility. I understand that hospital elevator cables snapping may seem ridiculous, and it really is, but you can't rule out this having happened at least once in documented history. As for the rest of the deaths, they're all easily explained. The umbrella death in episode three? Dying by falling down a flight stairs is entirely possible on its own, but regardless of this being in the original source or something P.A. Works changed, Dead Girl #1 falling on the umbrella was purely done for trying to hook the audience, and there is no easier way of doing that than making some over-the-top death scene which all the mindless little sheep will endlessly ejaculate over. Episode five? Heart attack. If I honestly have to explain this one, I'll probably lose what little hope I have left in humanity. Episode seven? Simple suicide. The real question here is why did the teacher who commited suicide have to make such a spectacle of his death? Here's a hint: shock value.And they aren't don't yet, oh no. Not only were most of the deaths earlier on in the series blown way out of proportion, P.A. Works felt the need to try and make episode eleven able to rival the entirety of a series like Higurashi in terms of deaths and overblown character reactions.

However, I will try my best to convey to you all\nas to why this show is truly a masterpiece that transcends the medium as a whole.GONZO is finally back in full force after a 2 year break. Now what do\nthey have to show for after these 2 long years? That would be Nyanpire. During these past few years, anime has been filled with pointless moe,\nexcessive fanservice, and are completely lacking of any substance. Because of this, Nyanpire is a bright light of hope for the industry in these dark\ntimes. Moving on to the story. GONZO shows a certain brilliance that has been lacking in anime for quite some time. The ability to use such a simple\npremise, yet execute it flawlessly has been almost completely lost in today's world. At the same time, the messages that they are trying to convey\nare something to be admired. GONZO really does care about the anime industry, and I must say, they are here to save it. Yet again, GONZO shows that\nsomething so simple, if used properly, can become something great. The art style is so very simplistic, it seems like any average person with no prior\nexperience could draw this show. What I draw from this (no pun intended) is that they are telling everyone that the art doesn't need to be excessive\nin any way (I'm looking at you, SHAFT) to serve it's purpose. Now, I'm not saying overly done art is bad, it just doesn't automatically make a\nshow good, and they prove this with Nyanpire's art.Sound, what can I say about the sounds of Nyanpire other than it's simply perfect. From the\nSeiyuu chosen, to the miscellaneous SFX used, and even to the ending theme done by Hyadain. It just screams perfection and will not leave you\ndisappointed.Now, for the main focus of the show, the characters. Nyanpire is truly a tragic character. Left to fend on his own after becoming a\nvampire-cat by drinking the blood of a vampire. His struggles to find blood to drink so that he may live on will truly fill your heart with sadness\nand despair, but at the same time, hope. Hope that he may one day get the blood he needs to continue living on in this world that shunned him long\nago. The life of Nyanpire will truly strike the hearts of anyone who watches this. I personally cannot wait for the other characters to be introduced\nso that I may be immersed into this masterpiece more so than I am now. I can already tell things are going to get real heavy once Masamunya\nappears.The enjoyment factor of this show, to put it simply, is one that cannot be rivaled within this lifetime. It has everything you will ever be\nlooking for in this medium, and only after 1 episode. If they continue on this course, there will never be a need for any other anime to be made. They\nwill have obtained the unobtainable.I never imagined this day would come, when something so amazing comes along that it leaves me in complete awe.\nI've gone back to edit my score for this repeatedly, but I just cannot fathom a rating that suits it.

However, I will try my best to convey to you all as to why this show is truly a masterpiece that transcends the medium as a whole.GONZO is finally back in full force after a 2 year break. Now what do they have to show for after these 2 long years? That would be Nyanpire.

An odd, somewhat of an outcast girl falls for the perfect, rich, most\npopular guy at school. Nothing new there, big whoop. The first episode or two might even cement that impression in your mind but don't be fooled, it\ndevelops into something so much more. Picture this way:\n\nYou're an individual who has a troubled past. You have been ostracized by various circumstances and nowadays, you don't give a damn what anyone\nthinks about you or your life. That is till you meet one of the hottest student at schoolwho takes an interest in you. Your heart pounds and for the\nfirst time in your life, you give a damn about your life and those around you especially regarding that student. That, my friends, is where Sukitte Ii\nna yo shines. It's a discovery and it's a classic.\n\nSukitte Ii na yo (also known as Say \"I Love You\".) is an anime series adapted from the manga written by Kanae Hazuki. The animation studio, Zexcs\nhandles its production which is already known for some of its past works in the romance department such as Da Capo, Fortune Arterial, and H2O:\nFootprints in the Sand. The series fits within the romance and drama side as opposed to a pure romantic comedy because of the story involved. \n\nLike I mentioned before, the series is a classic for those into the shoujo medium. It is like a breath of fresh air to watch especially with the\nlighthearted backgrounds presented. For those into some school drama involving the typical high school life, it's like a journey all over again. \n\nThe series kicks off with a girl named Mei Tachibana. She is nothing special although she used to get well along with others. Unfortunately, it seems\nthat events in the past has shut her down and made her an unsociable person. In fact, classmates who knows her describes Mei as a girl who keeps to\nherself with little words and a person stuck in her own little world. Yet at the same time, we can see Mei as an honest girl who is caring, loyal, and\nwilling to help others when the time calls for it. But time isn't always on her side especially during a day when she bumps heads to heads with the\nmost popular student at school. \n\nHere's where the drama kicks in and his name is Yamato Kurosawa.\n\nYamato is one of the most popular guys at school and his name may even suggest a male version of Yamato Nadeshiko (no pun intended). He meets Mei in a\nvery unusual way at school and later on so helps her with a problem involving a stalker. Yikes! Now, from there on and out, the two forms a bond\ndespite Mei's stubbornness. \n\nNow, the duo seems to very incompatible at first glance. I mean, Mei is one of the most plain looking girls at school with a plain way of dealing with\nher life. On the other hand, Yamato is the most popular guy at school who is idolized by many of the students. Sounds like living on the opposite of\nthe world, right? Yet, what these two individuals share in common is their willingness to take on life itself with their ways of helping others and\ndiscover themselves. It's a pleasant watch and a rare gem we don't see too common in today's shoujo theme series. Later on, Mei and Yamato forges a\nrelationship that seems to get quite the attention. \n\nI honestly think the duo are quite compatible that balances out each other. We know that Mei is a plain looking girl who is clumsy yet very honest\nwith herself and with others. Yamato often goes out helping his classmates as well by putting others above himself. We can see that he dislikes people\nwho just likes him for his appearance. When Yamato realizes that Mei likes him beyond just his physical appearance, the two becomes quite compatible.\nAlthough loathed by some of the other students at school, they are a good match. \n\nThe other characters also plays their roles in the story as well that often brings forth new surprises and obstacles to the couple. That brings for\nthe drama into the series. \n\nOn the male side, we have Kai Takemura who has very similar circumstances with Mei. Both of them had a past they wish they can forget but they manage\nto move on. After their encounter, Kai becomes part of the love triangle between Yamato, Mei, and himself. It's drama to the D especially when we see\nYamato's jealous and defensive side. On the female side, there is Megumi Kitagawa. She is seen as an idol on similar status with Yamato and is\npossibly what Mei wants to be: popular and beautiful. Yet, we see behind that outer shell is a very insecure girl who seems sweet but is only aiming\nat her own goals, aka Yamato. The three of them is a love triangle that makes Mei once again examine herself and the relationship she forms.\n\nThe overall execution of the series follows that typical shoujo theme ways of portraying its ways, settings, and backgrounds. As such, expect some\ncliched and predictable moments especially between the duo of Mei and Yamato. Even from the pilot episode, it can be easy to tell where the direction\nthe two are heading. The misunderstandings and some of the drama are also easy to see through especially involving Megumi. It's no surprising either\nthat in high school, all sort of situations happen and love is may just be one of them. The series takes that love between the duo and drives it\nthroughout each episode as obstacles and events are presented. It shows how much they discover themselves and how much they can change when they\nunderstand each other.\n\nThe artwork of the series is quite realistic and portrays the backgrounds with the school life setting. The various classrooms, playgrounds, and\ncharacters are real and needs to be in that way to convey to the viewers what high school is all about. Yuka Hirama (the art director) does a\nwonderful job of that crafting the characters. Mei is painted as a plain looking girl. Yamato is painted as cool looking guy. Megumi is painted as a\nschool idol with a beautiful figure. Kei is painted as a guy that used to have a rebellious nature. It is all there and the audience can see how each\nof them fits within their boundaries within the artwork department.\n\nSimilarly, the soundtrack of the series is lighthearted. Although not too well known, Yuuji Nomi engineers the series' music with his skills to\ncreate a sense of being there. It's nothing too special because it mostly is lighthearted and hardly noticeable at times. However, it is a sweet\nmelody that depicts the settings and the characters especially the opening song. \"Friendship ~ for Sukitte Ii na yo\" by Ritsuko Okazaki is a very\nlighthearted song that gives off that melody of sweetness which depicts the duo's sweet relationship. Similarly, the ED song follows the same suit to\nmatch the lightheartedness of the series.\n\nAll in all, Sukitte Ii na yo is a pleasant series to watch. The relationship between Mei and Yamato is quite warming and realistic to what some of us\nmay have experienced during our teen years. It's heartwarming, sweet, and at the same time has drama to it especially involving the other characters.\nIt is also a shoujo that fits within its boundaries without going over heels or trying too hard. Ultimately, it's a rare little gem that deserves\npraise for its beauty.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>The series at a first glance seems like a very stereotypical shoujo title. An odd, somewhat of an outcast girl falls for the perfect, rich, most popular guy at school. Nothing new there, big whoop. The first episode or two might even cement that impression in your mind but don't be fooled, it develops into something so much more. Picture this way:</p><p>You're an individual who has a troubled past. You have been ostracized by various circumstances and nowadays, you don't give a damn what anyone thinks about you or your life. That is till you meet one of the hottest student at schoolwho takes an interest in you. Your heart pounds and for the first time in your life, you give a damn about your life and those around you especially regarding that student. That, my friends, is where Sukitte Ii na yo shines. It's a discovery and it's a classic.</p><p>Sukitte Ii na yo (also known as Say \"I Love You\".) is an anime series adapted from the manga written by Kanae Hazuki.

Ultimately, it is\nyour normal anime with a dark feel, and a lot of comedy and romance latched onto it. However, the anime mostly contains comedy and romance which I\nfind it to be quite ironic. Usually the summaries written about this anime give you the feel of horror and mystery, but when you watch the episodes\nyou see too much romance. The only times you have a feeling of horror and mystery into it is when you see the Paranormal Investigation Club trying\ntheir very best to find clues about Yuuko’s death, or when Yuuko is pretending to be a ghost just to scare the crap out of the main characters which\nis only a total of four. Lastly, the anime is way too fast paced, I kept on getting confused on like how much time has passed during the anime. To\nsummarize it all up, I believe “Dusk Maiden of Amnesia” does a terrible job at showing any type of plot development because it gives me the feel that\nit is mainly concentrating on showing the relationship between Yuuko and Teiichi. \n\nCharacters:  \nThe main characters in this anime either show an advanced character development or an extreme lack of character development. The characters Yuuko and\nTeiichi are seen throughout this anime 80% of the time. I believe these two show too much character development because in just a short amount of time\nthey already act like lovers who’ve been together since childhood or something. The problem with this is that you see the same scene almost all the\ntime: Yuuko seducing Teiichi, Yuuko making fun of Teiichi, Yuuko touching Teiichi, Teiichi touching Yuuko, and both of them all lovey dovey. I love\nromance and all, but this is too much, I mean in just the first day they meet and you already see them on top of each other, it’s too much of a fast\ndevelopment for me. The other main characters Momoe and Kirie are pretty much shown 20% of the time throughout the whole entire series; they barely\nreceive any amount of screen time which results into barely any character development. As a result, I believe the creators only made them to act as\n‘extra’ club members.\n\nThe other problem I have with this anime is that it lacks background characters. I understand perfectly well that background characters are not that\nimportant to the anime, but seriously throughout the whole anime you just see four characters and their all the main characters! I don’t know if you\nunderstand this, but minor and background characters may not be that important to an anime, however when you see the same characters every episode,\nand no other characters at all, you slowly understand that minor and background characters play the crucial role of making it seem more realistic to\nthe viewer. I mean think about it, if you were a person trying their very best to find clues to some death at a school than you expect to see some\npeople who know some information about it, or at least you see just some random people off into the distance chatting about God knows what! But this\nanime doesn’t have any of that, just four characters in some big ass school. This anime takes place at a school, and at a school you have students,\nteachers, and all those other people, but there aren’t any of them around in this anime; it makes me think to myself “Where the hell are the other\nstudents? I mean I’m only seeing four characters the whole entire time, doesn’t anybody go to this school?” The only time I saw some actual background\ncharacters in this anime so far was on episode five, even if it was just a little bit it made me feel happy to know that some other people actually\nexist in this anime. \n\nArt:  \nThe art style of this anime seems like the only darn thing that is 100% perfectly fine! Even though the plot is all messed up, the art is like the\nonly thing that makes me give this anime a decent score of 7 out of 10. The colors used in this anime were so pretty it makes me feel like I’m looking\nat some painting. The animation was also very well done it had a great use of graphics and effects. Yep art perfect in every way. Indeed the\nbackground artists could do a bit more better job at making the backgrounds seem older to give the overall anime feel a bit of pizzazz, but it’s still\nfine just the way it is. Oh and did you guys know that the people who drew this anime did a great job at showing some fan service? Well now you know,\nso if you like these sort of animes with fan service than you might actually think “Holy crap, I’m in Heaven.”\n\nSound:  \nSeems okay, I have no problems with the voices used in this anime nor the opening and ending songs of the anime. Though I don't know why, but both\nopening and ending songs didn't seem to attract much attention to me, I didn't really like them that much, but I still thought it was good for the\nwhole mood. The only thing that needs fixing is the better use of background music to better add the mood of the events occurring throughout the show.\nIf the anime had some special sound effects or my favorite, motivational music than I bet I would have rated the anime a little higher maybe up to a\n7.5 if that option existed in MyAnimeList.net, I wish it did, it would make my reviews a lot more accurate. \n\nEnjoyment:  \nMy overall enjoyment to “Tasogare Otome x Amnesia” was definitely nothing special, I pretty much thought that it was boring. I didn't feel any type\nof suspense in this anime, no chair gripping, hair biting, mommy I’m scared moments. It was just me sitting there, staring at the computer pretty much\nbored out of my mind watching Yuuko and Teiichi have some fun. Some parts in the anime did make me awe in adoration or laugh out loud towards the\ncharacters or some moments happening in it. Though I mainly just felt bored throughout the whole thing. I did feel a bit of jealously watching this\nanime since Yuuko and Teiichi’s relationship together seem so perfect, they rarely have any arguments and such or some difficult obstacles they have\nto face in order for them to be together forever or something like that. I mean throughout the anime their always together, their love just seems\nperfect and all with no strings attached. God, you don’t know how much I want a relationship like theirs; just watching them all lovey dovey makes me\nfeel like I’ll be forever alone. \n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Dusk Maiden of Amnesia definitely seems like an acceptable anime with the little plots, synopsis, and summaries written about it.

If the anime had some special sound effects or my favorite, motivational music than I bet I would have rated the anime a little higher maybe up to a 7.5 if that option existed in MyAnimeList.net, I wish it did, it would make my reviews a lot more accurate. </p><p>Enjoyment:<br>My overall enjoyment to “Tasogare Otome x Amnesia” was definitely nothing special, I pretty much thought that it was boring. I didn't feel any type of suspense in this anime, no chair gripping, hair biting, mommy I’m scared moments. It was just me sitting there, staring at the computer pretty much bored out of my mind watching Yuuko and Teiichi have some fun. Some parts in the anime did make me awe in adoration or laugh out loud towards the characters or some moments happening in it. Though I mainly just felt bored throughout the whole thing. I did feel a bit of jealously watching this anime since Yuuko and Teiichi’s relationship together seem so perfect, they rarely have any arguments and such or some difficult obstacles they have to face in order for them to be together forever or something like that. I mean throughout the anime their always together, their love just seems perfect and all with no strings attached. God, you don’t know how much I want a relationship like theirs; just watching them all lovey dovey makes me feel like I’ll be forever alone. </p>","likesCount":4,"progress":null,"rating":16,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1608","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1608"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1608/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1608/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"4953","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4953/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:16:02.844Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"naruto-the-cross-roads","synopsis":"This year is the 10th anniversary of Naruto's serialization start.

Simply to say it is the journey of Naruto to become the best; however, he has to face conflicts within\nhimself, with others and with the world as well.\n\nDon't expect psychology, deep philosophy, and thought provoking issues here because Naruto was made for the general audience and tackles drama within\nthe character's personal lives as teenage ninjas, there are almost no societal issue here and war and politics are not a prominent figure. The story\nis about lives. The life of a ninja here is portrayed in a comedic and adventurous way in the eyes of mostly innocent youths who in time, will be able\nto learn about its darkness.\n\nBut what made Naruto so lovable? It is the universe it created. The villages, the clans and the people's lifestyle are so fun to learn about, they\nare so fun to be in. Plot twists are plentiful and the characters' interactions are very exciting. \n\nBut the heart of Naruto fandom is the ACTION; loved characters fighting with their well loved skills. Each of them has unique attributes coming from\ntheir bloodline or they developed personally. Most of the time, they think while they fight resulting into exciting clashes of logic and tactics.\nTheir powers also have 'scientific explanations' from the make-up science in this show giving room for countless forums and fan speculations where\ntheir strengths and weaknesses are discussed; example is \"who will win if...\"\n\nHowever, I was displeased with the development of the series; it started out really good but after episode 140 or so the anime was filled with useless\nfillers, totally useless and unenjoyable.They really ruined the show; It was a real disappointment to fans that the transition to Naruto Shippudden\nwas a total disgrace.\n\nOverall the story is very addictive and will keep you glued to the screen until the fillers came.\n\nArt (7/10)  \nThe character designs are very simple yet memorable, no character looked alike and each other and each has trademark outfits, which were not very\ndetailed. Eyes, noses, mouths and hair are nothing special making Naruto characters one of the easiest to draw.I also loved the use of symbols, such\nas the Konoha leaf and Naruto's spiral, they leave a considerable amount of impression to viewers.\n\nThe houses, shops, fashion, and art in general in Naruto are both landlord era and modern anime style inspired.\n\nYet the animation was very inconsistent; there are times when faces are so ugly and the action scenes, which are excellent, are poorly drawn\n(especially at the fillers).\n\nSound (8/10)  \nWhat I can say about the music of Naruto is that it is appropriate. The music was heavily Japanese themed and gives you a \"ninja\" feel. Though not\nexceptional it is not disappointing; if the scene is sad, the music will make you even sadder, and when there is action, the music will pump up your\nadrenalin. The opening and ending themes are quite enjoyable and addictive, making them highly anticipated.\n\nBut the length of the series made the music overly used and lacking in variation.\n\nCharacter(7/10)  \nThis part is very debatable...It is also the part that made Naruto hated by many, the main characters and also some secondary characters) are cliches:\n\nA boy who has a hidden power triggered if his nakama is in danger and wins over strong opponents by willpower\n\nA rival who is smart with looks better than the main character, fan-girled too much and has some dark undertone.\n\nA girl obsessed with the 'rival' who is liked by the unliked main character whom she constantly bullies\n\nMostly the characters are a bit shallow but they are worthy to be loved. Some of them are inspiring, some irritating, some cute, some has psychotic\nattributes and some are cool depending on a person's preference: a very good formula for a shonen anime. They are not mediocre and their role in the\nstory is noteworthy as many of them develops significantly as the series progresses, whereas each has his or own internal or external conflict. \n\nNaruto promotes many important values such as friendship, family, hardwork and maturity with its characters.I find it inspirational and heartwarming.\nI also loved its concept of having a \"home\"and to belong to and having a \"dream\" to work hard for. Overall the atmosphere is positive here.\n\nHOWEVER, the fillers made room for too many cheap, sissy dramas and trying-hard-to-be-deep- characters who are very unnecessary. The plentiful\nunnecessary flashbacks also ruin some climatic parts and made the drama bland.\n\nBut Naruto isn't very shallow at all. One can see it's unforced efforts to bring symbolism; a character living in bloodshed was associated to the\npureness of snow, the blooming of flower as a metaphor for growth, and the leaves of the village compared to the next generation or the progression of\ntime.\n\nAngst and sadness is plentiful here but they are viewed from the eyes of pre-teens and pre-teens are mostly shallow no matter how deep they think they\nare. But it doesn't mean that the drama is shallow, it was just portrayed naturally from the characters' point of view.\n\nNaruto, though he is a typical shonen hero, has a different effect on people and has an amazing power to impact both the characters of the show and\naudiences alike. His development is superb: from a naughty, proud and idiotic outcast kid he strove hard to be recognized by following his way of a\nninja to become an inspiration to everybody.\n\nEnjoyment (8/10)  \nI loved it so much...I've been addicted to it for three years. Even though I watch new series, Naruto still remain in my top list. My experience in\nwatching this is very different from other shonens, and conversing with fans alike will make you feel very welcomed in loving this series.I can\nextract endless fun information from the series and fansites. It is just that the fillers really ruined the mood...\n\nNaruto is not exceptional in every aspect(except action and comedy perhaps) if you compare it to very artistically done animes but it may be the best\nin one thing: earning people with unconditonal fandom despite its weaknesses. Isn't it a very rare attribute?\n\n\"It's just popular but not really good.\" Then why is it popular in the first place? It is because the majority loved it and don't care about its\nflaws. Naruto is very age-friendly and gender friendly, and a very well composed shonen.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Story (7/10)<br>Naruto's story revolved around a obnoxious kid named Naruto, if you don't like him, then it's not very likely that you'll love the series. </p><p>The plot is a bit shallow and a bit of a cliche; a stupid main character who wants to attempt the impossible and has a hidden power behind his sadness having stereotypical nakamas to protect.

Their powers also have 'scientific explanations' from the make-up science in this show giving room for countless forums and fan speculations where their strengths and weaknesses are discussed; example is \"who will win if...\"</p><p>However, I was displeased with the development of the series; it started out really good but after episode 140 or so the anime was filled with useless fillers, totally useless and unenjoyable.They really ruined the show; It was a real disappointment to fans that the transition to Naruto Shippudden was a total disgrace.</p><p>Overall the story is very addictive and will keep you glued to the screen until the fillers came.</p><p>Art (7/10)<br>The character designs are very simple yet memorable, no character looked alike and each other and each has trademark outfits, which were not very detailed. Eyes, noses, mouths and hair are nothing special making Naruto characters one of the easiest to draw.I also loved the use of symbols, such as the Konoha leaf and Naruto's spiral, they leave a considerable amount of impression to viewers.</p><p>The houses, shops, fashion, and art in general in Naruto are both landlord era and modern anime style inspired.</p><p>Yet the animation was very inconsistent; there are times when faces are so ugly and the action scenes, which are excellent, are poorly drawn (especially at the fillers).</p><p>Sound (8/10)<br>What I can say about the music of Naruto is that it is appropriate. The music was heavily Japanese themed and gives you a \"ninja\" feel. Though not exceptional it is not disappointing; if the scene is sad, the music will make you even sadder, and when there is action, the music will pump up your adrenalin. The opening and ending themes are quite enjoyable and addictive, making them highly anticipated.</p><p>But the length of the series made the music overly used and lacking in variation.</p><p>Character(7/10)<br>This part is very debatable...It is also the part that made Naruto hated by many, the main characters and also some secondary characters) are cliches:</p><p>A boy who has a hidden power triggered if his nakama is in danger and wins over strong opponents by willpower</p><p>A rival who is smart with looks better than the main character, fan-girled too much and has some dark undertone.</p><p>A girl obsessed with the 'rival' who is liked by the unliked main character whom she constantly bullies</p><p>Mostly the characters are a bit shallow but they are worthy to be loved. Some of them are inspiring, some irritating, some cute, some has psychotic attributes and some are cool depending on a person's preference: a very good formula for a shonen anime. They are not mediocre and their role in the story is noteworthy as many of them develops significantly as the series progresses, whereas each has his or own internal or external conflict. </p><p>Naruto promotes many important values such as friendship, family, hardwork and maturity with its characters.I find it inspirational and heartwarming. I also loved its concept of having a \"home\"and to belong to and having a \"dream\" to work hard for. Overall the atmosphere is positive here.</p><p>HOWEVER, the fillers made room for too many cheap, sissy dramas and trying-hard-to-be-deep- characters who are very unnecessary. The plentiful unnecessary flashbacks also ruin some climatic parts and made the drama bland.</p><p>But Naruto isn't very shallow at all. One can see it's unforced efforts to bring symbolism; a character living in bloodshed was associated to the pureness of snow, the blooming of flower as a metaphor for growth, and the leaves of the village compared to the next generation or the progression of time.</p><p>Angst and sadness is plentiful here but they are viewed from the eyes of pre-teens and pre-teens are mostly shallow no matter how deep they think they are. But it doesn't mean that the drama is shallow, it was just portrayed naturally from the characters' point of view.</p><p>Naruto, though he is a typical shonen hero, has a different effect on people and has an amazing power to impact both the characters of the show and audiences alike. His development is superb: from a naughty, proud and idiotic outcast kid he strove hard to be recognized by following his way of a ninja to become an inspiration to everybody.</p><p>Enjoyment (8/10)<br>I loved it so much...I've been addicted to it for three years. Even though I watch new series, Naruto still remain in my top list. My experience in watching this is very different from other shonens, and conversing with fans alike will make you feel very welcomed in loving this series.I can extract endless fun information from the series and fansites. It is just that the fillers really ruined the mood...</p><p>Naruto is not exceptional in every aspect(except action and comedy perhaps) if you compare it to very artistically done animes but it may be the best in one thing: earning people with unconditonal fandom despite its weaknesses. Isn't it a very rare attribute?</p><p>\"It's just popular but not really good.\" Then why is it popular in the first place? It is because the majority loved it and don't care about its flaws. Naruto is very age-friendly and gender friendly, and a very well composed shonen.</p>","likesCount":13,"progress":null,"rating":14,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1610","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1610"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1610/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1610/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"4240","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/4240/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:05:09.834Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"k-on","synopsis":"Hirasawa Yui, a young, carefree girl entering high school, has her imagination instantly captured when she sees a poster advertising the \"Light Music Club.\" Being the carefree girl that she is, she quickly signs up; however, Yui has a problem, she is unable to play an instrument.\n\nWhen Yui goes to the clubroom to explain, she's greeted by the other members: Ritsu, Mio, and Tsumugi.

Well, first of all this has probably been on my on-hold list since the time I joined MAL,\nback in April. I tried several times to start it again and watch it, but time and time again, it didn't really hold my interest. A few days ago, I\ndecided that I should just get it over with and finish it, so I sat down at my computer, went to my favorite streaming site, yes I don't download\nanime onto my computer, and began to watch, and I have to say, this has to be one of the best comedies I've ever watched in my short anime\nlifetime.Let's start with the story. If you are looking for a compelling story that follows it's events then this is not for you because time often\nchanges in large stretches of time, although for me I didn't really notice it. Also, if you think this will be like NANA (does it really look like\nNANA, people?) or Nodame Cantabile (again does this even look like Nodame Cantabile), this series isn't for you either. However, if you are looking\nfor something fun, interesting, and cute to watch this series \\[i\\]is\\[/i\\] for you. K-on basically follows 4, eventually 5, girls around as they\nestablish the Light Music Club and the friendship that follows. Whether it's going to training camps at Mugi's \"small\" summer villas, hanging out\nin the music room eating Mugi's sweets, or actually practicing these girls are always having fun. There really isn't any drama in this series and it\nis throughout it's 13 episodes, a fun and fluffy show with really now plot.Yay, the music. The music in here really depends on your personal\npreferences. This music isn't classical, or punk rock, but a bouncy, kind of peppy, upbeat music that I found myself thoroughly enjoying. I,\npersonally LOVED the OP and ED themes. I liked the upbeat tone to them and just thought that they were awesome. The songs performed by the girls are\ngreat too, and I found myself tapping my fingers to the beat and wishing it would go on. The background music and such isn't very memorable, but\nit's good all the same.The art, was something that I liked and thought was very eye appealing. K-on is from KyoAni, which we all know for Clannad,\nAir, and Kanon 2006, at for me, at least, I thought that they did a very good job with the art. Yes, the art was choppy in some places, but for the\nmost part it was very nice and I thought if was nice. The characters' eyes, I especially liked. The backgrounds were very nice, eye catching,\nalthough probably not as much as Clannad for instance.Now for the characters. We have clumsy, forgetful, but overall very lovable Yui, shy, mature,\nscaredy-cat Mio, provider of sweets and all around good person Mugi, the club's headstrong and confident \"leader\" Ritsu, and the newest addition\nAzusa. Before I got into K-on I noticed that Mio had a huge fan-base, and I had always wondered what was so great about this character. Well, I have\nto say that I have found myself apart of that very fan base as the series went on and we got to know Mio better. She is Ritsu's best friend, an\nextremely shy person and a major scardy-cat, which Ritsu plays on constantly. Mio was sucked into joining the Light Music Club by Ritsu, originally\nintending to join the Literature Club. She is the one of the most mature people in the band, unsuccessfully trying to get the members to play more\noften and more seriously. She serves as the song writer, occasional vocalist, and bass player on the band.Yui is probably my favorite character in the\nwhole show. Now this show does not have much character growth at all. Yui is probably one, if not the only character to go through some sort of\ngrowth. At the beginning, Yui is lazy, and doesn't really know what she is going to do with herself in high school. She is clumsy and doesn't\nunderstand many things. She also has a tendency to forget something she's learned when she's learned something new, causing some grief for the other\nmembers of the Light Music club. Yui enters high school and goes in determined to join a club, the one problem being that she has no idea what club\nshe should join. She eventually happens upon a flier for the Light Music Club and decides to join thinking that Light meant castanets. Described by\nRitsu as clumsy and a girl with no rhythm, Yui has it had the first few weeks having to learn how to play the guitar from scratch and actually having\nto buy a guitar, although Mugi's sweets and tea were a constant gift to her and something she looked forward to everyday. Eventually she progresses\ngreatly for someone who was just leaning and the Light Music Club has it's guitarist, and eventually a main vocalist. Yui's sister and her friend\nNodoka notice the changes that Yui goes through and are amazed at her transformation after joining the Light Music Club. Yui becomes confident and\nmentions herself that she was unsure of what she was going to do with herself at the beginning of high school, but now knows that she can do it\nwhatever it may be. I love Yui because she was sweet and was clumsy in a cute sort of way. She went about her merry ways and tried to make everyone as\nhappy as she possibly could. I thought she was a great character and really added to the story.Mugi, the sweet and all around good person, that you\ncan't help but like. Although she comes from a rich family, she is very modest and doesn't flaunt her wealth around. Her family owns multiple\nvillas, which the club members visit twice for their summer training camps. Mugi, was another member who didn't intend to join the Light Music Club.\nOriginally intending to join the choir, she mistook the Music Room for the Choir Room and was convinced to join by Ritsu's \"tragic story\" of the\nband that she and Mio had promised to make. Mugi is the provider of sweets for the band members, bringing tea sets, cakes, cookies, and other sweets\nthat the band members, especially Yui enjoy. She plays the keyboard in the band.Ritsu, the one that started it all. Ritsu serves as the club leader\nand often forgets to fill out important papers, leading to the wrath of Mio. She and Mio were the first members for the Light Music Club. Probably one\nof the funniest characters in the series, Ritsu is loud and outgoing, often playing tricks on her best friend Mio. She gets along extremely well with\nYui and when I first started the series I had a hard time telling them apart sometimes. I love Ritsu because she is a funny person, and radiates\nconfidence. She plays the drums in the band. Last, but not least, the newest member Azusa. Azusa entered high school with Yui's younger sister and is\nin the same class. She joined the Light Music Club after seeing them perform and was shocked at the way that they spent their afternoons in the\nclubroom. She often pushes for more practice and a more serious attitude towards their music. However, she eventually lets it go as she becomes more\nadjusted. There isn't a lot mentioned about Azusa, other than she plays the guitar (pretty well too) and that her parents are jazz players. The\nsupporting characters in K-on were very nice and added a lot to the story. From Yui's responsible and loving sister, to the eccentric club adviser\n\"Sawa-chan\" who loves to dress the girls up, they all had an important role and K-on wouldn't have been K-on without them. Now,I will not deny that\nI am a complete and utter amateur when it comes to telling a good voice acting from a bad one, but to me all the voices were nice and I thought that\nthe people behind them did a good job. Overall the characters were great and played their roles wonderfully in the story.Overall, I enjoyed this show\na lot. From the characters to the music, I thought it was all great and that KyoAni did another good job with an anime. When I started this show\nagain, I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was and how much I enjoyed it. I think that this was a fantastic show and\nthat if you like cute characters, a comedy that doesn't have much of a plot, or you're simply just looking for something fun to watch, then K-on is\ndefinitely an anime that you should watch.~By the way, this is my first review, so constructive criticism and comments are much appreciated. ^^ ~\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>\"I love K-On!\"-Hirasawa, YuiK-On, what to say about it.

I think that this was a fantastic show and that if you like cute characters, a comedy that doesn't have much of a plot, or you're simply just looking for something fun to watch, then K-on is definitely an anime that you should watch.~By the way, this is my first review, so constructive criticism and comments are much appreciated. ^^ ~ </p>","likesCount":1,"progress":null,"rating":18,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1613","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1613"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1613/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1613/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"6255","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6255/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:36:56.330Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"persona-4-the-animation","synopsis":"Yuu Narukami moves to Inaba, a seemingly quiet and ordinary town, where he quickly befriends the clumsy transfer student Yousuke Hanamura, the energetic Chie Satonaka, and the beautiful heiress Yukiko Amagi.

At the end of the OVA you'll be emotional and not complaining about the character design.I liked it!

The majority of the story takes place at a magical academy where\nstudents train to become successful mages. Everybody has their own specialty whether it be earth magic or water. Enter Louise de long name not worth\ntyping out. Louise is a high strung and cocky mage wannabe who can't do much of anything right. Every spell she attempts to cast seems to fail\nmiserably and just blow things up. During the ceremony to summon what is to be your familiar forever more, she ends up summoning a boy by the name of\nSaito who comes from our world; more particularly Japan. So while everybody else has salamanders, moles, frogs and other creatures, Louise has a boy. \n\nThe story progression is all about the relationship that builds between Louise and Saito. She treats him like a familiar, or to be more precise like a\nslave pet. He has to wash her clothes, do her menial chores and even sleeps on the floor. Throughout the show their relationship begins to develop\nmore and small plot twists are slowly introduced. Why the boy is special. Why Louise just seems to mess everything up. \n\nThe overall story in ZnT is nothing that hasn't been done before. I don't like to grade based on precedence though as it is not fair to the subject\nmatter. Louise and Saito slowly come together to make a good team and other characters are introduced that turn the show into \"Friends\" just with\nspell casting. It does get quite serious towards the latter part of the series, and I would say that it was actually pulled off quite nicely. \n\nArt  \nAs I said in my opening paragraph, the initial thing that even got me to watch this show was Louise. I do hate to admit but I thought she was hot. I\ncompletely understand if you hit that back button right now. Even after the show is done, I still do. Remember, the back button is at the top left of\nyour browser window, or you can just hit backspace. Anyway, the characters are all quite attractive in their actual originality. It does have the\nwhole JC Staff production feel to it in the character design, but they are all nicely done. Although if you have a problem with the male in anime\nalways looking like an average guy, you'll likely not like Saito's overall design. But if you enjoy big eyed cute girls, lolis, big breasted fiery\nred heads; then this show is gonna make you have a nerdgasm. \n\nThankfully the background animations are all paid attention to. Usually in shows like this, all the detail goes into character development and the\nbackground is left to die in a dark corner. Thankfully this wasn't the case with ZnT. Another thing that caught me by surprise is that they managed\nto throw in some obvious CG scenes without them standing out too much or just ruining the whole animation feel. When many shows throw CG into the mix,\nthey make it stick out and just look awful, almost to say \"check out what we can do.\" ZnT does a wonderful job of balancing it out and pulls off a\nsolid animation effort in the end.\n\nSound  \nThe first things that should always been addressed in the sound department is the opening and closing songs. Dead on! The opening is \"First Kiss\" by\nIchiko and couldn't be more fitting for the tone of the show. The lyrics make much more sense than many Japanese songs tend to, and quite frankly\nit's catchy. Definitely recommended for the playlists out there. The background was fitting, which is really all you can ask from anime. The music\nplayed always fit the situation and there were a few that stuck out and were able to do a masterful job of getting the viewer into the emotional\nsituation. Playful music was the main course for the show as it tends to be much more humorous and whimsical than anything. But when it got serious,\nthe music did a great job of presenting that to the viewer. \n\nThe voice acting was actually quite phenomenal. Every character fit their personalities well. Even though I can't stand the overly effeminate\ncharacters in anime, at least he was voiced well. Louise had the very defiant, cocky and sometimes very vulnerable feel to here. I thought of her kind\nof as I did Naru from Love Hina. Except not so much of a b\\*tch (God I hate Naru). Saito was considerably better than many main male characters\nusually are. For once in anime, the guy wasn't represented by a complete and total nerd. He was actually a strong, intelligent and thoughtful guy. He\nhad his moments, but overall when he talked, he kinda made me proud for us; for once. But the voice acting award has to go Nanako Inoue as Kirche.\nKirche was the virtual arch-rival of Louise. She was one of the good ones at magic and made a point to rub it in the face of Louise as much as she\ncould. Her character was given the voice of condescending know-it-all. She was also the school flirt, a serious mage and a seductress. Japanese women\ncan be sexy, but their voices rarely scream sexual seduction. She manages to seduces the viewer, male viewer, quite nicely. That's an accomplishment.\n\nPresentation  \nAt the end of the day, ZnT is a short anime that is just entertaining. It doesn't provide a terribly deep plot. Many of the tools used in this show\nhave been used many times before. The characters can be considered somewhat cliche. But that may be one of its charms. It doesn't make you think\noutside of your anime paradigm. It just allows you to sit down and enjoy the hijinks and life of some crazy characters. I can say that I just\ncouldn't stop watching it once I started; it is one of those shows that just makes time fly so much faster. \n\nIf you have had your fill of \"guy can't admit to girl, girl can't admit to guy\", girl hit guy for no reason or anything like that, you may want to\nsteer clear from watching Zero no Tsukaima. Everybody else will pull something out of it in end that they will enjoy. I guarantee it. \n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Zero no Tsukaima takes place in an alternate world where magic and dragons exist.

That being said, it's\nactually not that bad.\n\nThe premise of Sister Princess is, you got Wataru Minakami, this ordinary guy, well, as ordinary as you can be for being rich and a total loser, that\nfails the exams for his only choice of high school. As a result, he gets kidnapped by tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum and is sent to a school on an island\nwhere he finds out that he has not one, but twelve sisters of varying ages that he never knew about, look nothing alike, and seem to come from\ndifferent countries. Hilarity ensues. Before I go any further, no, it is never mentioned whether his father is a playboy, mother is a whore, or how in\nthe vast cosmos you could have twelve sisters that have no resemblance to each other.\n\nThe premise sounds like a set-up for an incestual harem anime, but actually, it works rather well as a plain old comedy about sisters that love their\nbrother and cause humorous or heartwarming situations. I would at most call it a \"Family Harem\".  The series is \"clean\", and by that I mean if you\ndislike fanservice(I don't), then you will have no problem with this show as there is slim to none; there would be very few qualms showing this\nseries to kids. If you have any problems with incest(I don't), then you may turned off to know that there is a bit of incestual sub-text, but you\nwill be glad to know that is mainly restricted to small teases from the seductive, sexy, eldest sister, Sakuya. Beyond that, the sisters genuinely\nlove their brother, and by that I mean in the \"my older brother is always there for me\" way, and not the \"I want to foodangle him\" way.\n\nAs stated, I would call this a \"Family Harem\" anime. The main plot of the series is not about these girls throwing themselves at Wataru, but about\nhow his life is slowly changed little-by-little because of his sisters. It does follow some of the tropes of harems, such as episodes focusing on him\ngetting closer to one specific character, but it is never romantic and always humorous and heartwarming. He starts off as a loser, but by the end\nbecomes a pretty cool guy as a result of his sisters. In this way, the series has some character development, nothing deep, but it's there which is a\nplus.\n\nThe series remains good throughout. It is consistently funny, not gut-bursting, but decent chuckle worthy. The series also has some nice touching\nmoments, nothing big, but you'll probably smile from them. All that being said, the series has a slow pace at times, a couple of the less interesting\nepisodes nearly slow enough to bore. The designs of the characters are nothing that special, but they fit the characters. Animation-wise, it's what\nyou would expect from an early 2000's show from Zexcs, that is, not great, but okay. The music too is not special, but the opening is surprisingly\ncatchy for a somewhat silly and serious song that repeats \"Aenai, ai, ai, ai\" over and over again.\n\nComparing the sub to the dub, this is an anime where I actually preferred the English dubbed over the subtitled. The script does a nice job adapting\nthe cute names each sister has for Wataru, from \"onii-chan\", \"tan\", \"san\", etc., to \"Big Bro\", \"Brother Dearest\", \"Brother Mine\", and so\non. The English dub also gets bonus points for giving some of the girls fitting, if not somewhat stereotypical, accents that were missing in the\noriginal Japanese cut. A song half-way through the series that could have easily been ruined, is given a great translation into English and stands out\nin it's own right as a good Christmas song.\n\nOverall, Sister Princess is not exactly a stand-out anime, but it is good enough to not be a waste of time, and I still re-watch every now and again\nwhen I've got nothing to do. I recommend giving a watch at least once, and if you enjoy it, I would recommend the sort-of sequel [Sister Princess\nRePure][1](actually, that is the only time I would recommend the sequel).\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.hummingbird.ly/anime/sister-princess-repure\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Sister Princess is a 26 episode series based on the light novels, and subsequent video games, of the same name.  The adaption is from Zexcs, also known as \"that company that made My-Hime and Da Capo\", and barely follows the already somewhat lose plot of the original.

For starters it is created by a certain Yoshitoke ABe, whose contributions helped to\nbring such works as Texhnolyze and of course, Serial Experiments Lain. Haibane is a relatively large departure from those series opting for a more\npeaceful feel and none of the mind-trickery that you would find in anime like Lain. It still has its weird elements, but overall forms a much more\nsimple tone which towards the end becomes a heartfelt drama.Haibane Renmei depicts a town whose whereabouts, or even if it is in this world is\nunknown. In this town exist humans as well as creatures known as Haibane adorned with wings and a halo above their heads. They are born from cocoons\nat various ages with no recollection of who they once were or their names. Instead their names are representative of whatever dream they had while\ninside of the cocoon. The story itself follows Rakka, a girl who hatches at the beginning of the series with no recollection of the dream she had\nexcept that she remembers falling.Haibane Renmei has a rather slow start using the first six or so episodes to introduce characters and give a\ndetailed interpretation of the world of the Haibane. These episodes had a quite peaceful feel which served as a brilliant contrast to the events that\noccur later in the story. Around episodes six or so things begin to change in the world of the Haibane and the peaceful happy-go-lucky attitude that\nwas built up in the previous episodes is quickly torn apart by a rapidly developing, but logically paced plot. This is when the series really begins\nto shine, all the development that we sat through in the first few episodes now has a purpose in the grand scheme of the series and the way in which\nevery aspect of the plot begins to come together towards the end of the series is nothing short of beautiful. It is well constructed and emotionally\nimpactful in a way that is rarely seen in anime. The problem is, it ends. The story is way too short as there are really only the final six episodes\nthat affect the plot as a whole. Upon its conclusion I just had this feeling that there was so much more that they could have done with the series but\nnever got around to actually doing it and made the conclusion feel weaker than it should have been. Not to mention that the list of unanswered\nquestions as a result of the short length is astronomical in length.This shortened length also has a great effect on the character development as only\nthe two main leads (Rakka and Reki) were legitimately layered as characters and the rest just seemed to take on very static character tropes. I feel\nthat if more time was granted to the series, these characters could've been explored to the same degree that the main two were. The series seemed to\nestablish these grand backstories for each of the characters that were just waiting to be explored but then really only explored a single character\nwhich made the other characters to seem weak in comparison. The shortened, length which drastically affects both the characters and the overall plot\nof Haibane Renmei is my only real fault with the series though it is a very major one that is extremely difficult to ignore. Probably the most\nnoticeable thing about Haibane Renmei would be the soundtrack which has quickly become one of my all time favourites. It isn’t just that the\nsoundtrack is good, it is also used at the exact time in which it is needed in the series. There is not as single second of music that feels in anyway\nout of place and overall it really makes every single scene much more emotionally impactful than it would have been if it were to be silent. It can\ncarry both the emotional and peaceful sides of Haibane Renmei perfectly on its shoulders and always keeps the emotion of the series flowing in a very\neffective manner. The art is good though sometimes is a bit overly simplistic and at other times a bit overly complex. The art really doesn’t have too\nmuch consistency in terms of complexity which allows the art style to shift depending on the mood that the series is taking. The simple character\ndesigns really help to complement the very peaceful part of the series, particularly the first half and the more complex designs compliment the\nemotion of later episodes very well. I occasionally noticed a few odd animations but they were few and far between and were never able to take away\nfrom the immersion factor of the series.In conclusion Haibane Renmei is an extremely good series that is brought down by an depressingly short\nrun-time. Had the series made more money there could have been room for a sequel but sadly it was the not the most popular series out there and\nremained stuck with what it got. That being said the plot is interesting and very well presented and the main the characters have a degree of depth to\nthem that you rarely ever see. Combine this with the mind-bogglingly good soundtrack and you have yourself and great series with one crippling\nfault.8.5/10\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Haibane Renmei is definitely a very interesting anime to review.

I think it has more to due with the cultural differences between\nme in Canada, and Japan than anything else. Sure there have been some comedies that were better than others, but every time I watched an anime comedy\nI always had this odd thought in my head that I could get far more laughs per episode in western television. However, with every rule there must be an\nexception, and I believe that I have found it.Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita, or Humanity has Declined is a post-apocalyptic comedy in which the human\nrace is on the brink of extinction. Taking humanity’s place as the dominant species are tiny creatures known simply as fairies. The story itself\nfollows a nameless woman who acts as an arbitrator between the humans and the fairies to help preserve humanity’s place on earth. With that synopsis\nthe show sounds rather depressing, and in a very small way, it is. What it does however is hide this tiny bit of depression and darkness behind a\ncolourful facade of craziness. This craziness is supported excellently by the very bright art style which really helps you take things lightly and\nlaugh at what would otherwise be a very depressing situation. The episodes themselves are divided into two episode arcs each focusing around different\ncharacters and time periods, with only the protagonist remaining consistent. When examining a comedy you have to ask, what makes it funny? For Jinrui\nit is its characters. The characters in Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita always felt varied and each of them have their own unique traits and there is\nalways more to them below the surface. The most interesting being the protagonist who is easily one of the best protagonists I have seen in general.\nWhat made her so interesting is that she was far from stupid and far from cute. By that I mean that while she was visibly cute, she had this maturity\nabout her that allowed me to enjoy her much more as a character. She always gave off this vibe of being very strong as a character and as the series\ngoes on, you begin to learn more and more things about her. The other characters on the show are interesting and varied as well, by that I mean they\nare not simply “One gag characters” as I am so used to seeing in comedies. I often find that anime characters, especially in comedies seem shallow and\nare only placed in the show to retell two or three select jokes throughout the entire series. The characters in Jinrui are not like this, they tell\njokes that fit their personalities, instead of having personalities that fit their jokes. This allowed the characters to remain vibrant and never\nbecome dull throughout their respective story arcs. Hell, even if you don’t like a character, aside from the protagonist you know that you will only\nhave to spend 2 episodes with a character before their arc ends. As a safe warning I will tell you that this show is quite weird. For me that was no\nproblem as I thought it really did add to the fun of the show and really helped to explain that none of the content in the series should be taken too\nseriously. However, if you are the kind of person who thinks that headless chicken crime bosses are a little outside of your comfort zone then you may\nwant to think twice before going into this with the belief that it is just another comedy. As well this anime can be rather confusing as the episodes\nare told completely out of order. At first I was against this style of storytelling as it seemed rather pointless and it felt like they were telling\nit out of order for the sake of telling it out of order. I still treat it as a fault as it was rather annoying in some areas but it was still somewhat\nfun for me to examine each arc and try to figure out exactly when it takes place.One thing that deserves special recognition in Jinrui is the art as\nit is very colourful and very different from what we are used to seeing in anime. As I said before, I believe that this art style was put to use\nbrilliantly in order to lighten up a depressing world. It made things seem very cheerful and it made you ignore the fact that you are witnessing the\ndying days of an entire species. For me the art style, while a little too bright at some points really did fit the show perfectly and I know that it\nwould be far less enjoyable if it did not have this candy-coated look to it. As for the music, it is not the most noticeable out there, but it is far\nfrom bad and it does have one of the best ending themes I have ever heard. In the end this show is nothing if not fun. Yes it is weird, yes it has its\nfaults but I still enjoyed every minute of it and it left me wanting more which for a comedy is all it really needs. If odd situations and\noverly-bright art are not your things, then feel free to stay away. However, I do need to recommend this as it is by far the most enjoyable comedy\nthat I have ever seen. For that I give it a 9/10.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>I would like to begin this review by simply stating that I do not like comedy anime.

However, his only companion is a self-proclaimed bodyguard named Madara. Fondly referred to as Nyanko-sensei, Madara is a mysterious, pint-sized feline spirit who has his own reasons for sticking with the boy.\n\nBased on the critically acclaimed manga by Yuki Midorikawa, Natsume Yuujinchou is an unconventional and supernatural slice-of-life series that follows Natsume as he, with his infamous protector Madara, endeavors to free the spirits bound by his grandmother's contract.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":167,"titles":{"en":"Natsume's Book of Friends","en_jp":"Natsume Yuujinchou","en_us":"Natsume's Book of Friends","ja_jp":"夏目友人帳"},"canonicalTitle":"Natsume Yuujinchou","abbreviatedTitles":["Natsume Yujincho","Natsume Yujin-cho"],"averageRating":"81.64","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"372","3":"1","4":"33","5":"4","6":"41","7":"4","8":"306","9":"4","10":"265","11":"10","12":"672","13":"32","14":"2317","15":"93","16":"3794","17":"125","18":"2755","19":"54","20":"4307"},"userCount":35889,"favoritesCount":1011,"startDate":"2008-07-08","endDate":"2008-09-30","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":260,"ratingRank":331,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3453/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3453/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3453/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3453/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/3453/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/3453/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/3453/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/3453/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/3453/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":310,"youtubeVideoId":"mea4xITAo_4","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1626/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1626/media"}},"user":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1626/relationships/user","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1626/user"}},"createdAt":"2013-03-17T12:41:58.440Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-19T07:57:10.566Z","content":"This reviews a review on the four current seasons as I feel that they should be combined into one reviewEvery once in awhile you get an anime with a\nvery simple premise and very simple ambitions. Sometime these animes will exceed these ambitions and become something special. In the case of\nNatsume’s Book of Friends, or Natsume Yuujinchou, it exceeds its meager ambitions and then some to become one of the most beautiful things that I have\never seen.The plot at its base level is actually quite cliche. It follows Natsume Takashi, a boy who has just started high school. Takashi can see\nspirits who are invisible to almost all humans. One day he ends up inheriting an old book from his recently deceased grandmother. Inside the book is a\ncollection of incomprehensible and random scribbles. The next day he is attacked by a spirit who is asking for the “Book of Friends”, Takashi is used\nto being chased by these spirits so he does the natural thing and runs. While attempting to escape he accidentally releases a seal that has been\nplaced on a spirit. This spirit turns out to be a rather, shall we say, rounded cat. Surprisingly this cat is actually a very powerful spirit. This\nspirit tells Takashi of the Book of Friends, the book that he received from his deceased grandmother. When his grandmother, Reiko was young, she would\nchallenge various spirits to duels. If they won they could do whatever they want with her. If she won they would write their name in the book of\nfriends, which would give her control over them if she desired. She never lost a single duel, as well she never made any of these spirits do anything.\nMany spirits find this book desirable as they would want to be able to control a large number of powerful spirits. Takashi takes it upon himself to\nreturn every name that is included in the Book of Friends and, in repayment for undoing the seal, the cat, now dubbed Nyanko-sensei by Takashi agrees\nto be his bodyguard under the condition that if and when Takashi loses his life, Nyanko-sensei will receive the Book of Friends.This anime is an\nepisodic anime, and there is no specific plot. Despite that there are 50 episodes of this show to date and I feel that all of them have their own\nunique purpose. This has been the first time with an anime of this length where I still felt that I needed more, not because I need to know what\nhappens, it’s just that every single one of these episodes felt unique in their own way. There are similarities between episodes however and I feel\nthat the episodes can be, more or less divided into three tiers, the episodes in these tiers share similar themes and overall quality with each\nother.The first tier and definitely the worst tier is the Takashi and spirit episodes. These episodes consist of Takashi helping a spirit with their\nproblem and may or may not run into one of the two exorcists of the show. The problem with these episodes is a result of Takashi’s character. In a\nsense he acts as a bridge between the humans and the spirits that he can see, and in these episodes, without being able to interact with other humans\nhe seems to lose a bit of his humanity. On top of that these episodes are actually quite predictable. It basically ends with Takashi floundering about\ndoing seemingly nothing until Deus Ex Machina a, b, or c decides to show up and save the day. That is how the majority of these episodes end and it\ngot old for me real fast. They aren’t bad, they are just extremely average and predictable though there are a few in this category which i would\nconsider special.Now we move on to the second tier, and respectively the second best type of episode. These episodes are what I like to call the human\nspirit connection episodes. Unlike the first tier this one takes Takashi’s role as a bridge between the humans and spirits and makes good use of it.\nThese episodes are designed to show the relationship and major differences between the world the spirits live in, and the world that we as humans live\nin. It shows how while both parties are able to think and feel emotion, they are worlds apart at the same time. These episodes made for some of the\nmore thought provoking episodes as the themes they showed were generally quite interesting to think about.Finally we come to the third, final, and\nbest tier, the flashback tier. surprisingly, the best episodes of this anime were definitely the flashback episodes. This is due to the way that\nTakashi develops as a character over the course of the series. Takashi’s past is well, a bit depressing to say the least. Both of his parents died at\na very young age and as such Takashi has been passed to his distant relatives. However because of his ability to see spirits, he would often get\nscared and scream at what appeared to others as nothing. Other children regarded him as a freak and eventually his relatives would decide he was too\nmuch of a hassle and send him off to another family. This happened until he ended up with the Fujiwara family just when he began high school. As he\nbegins high school, he has a fresh new start and this time makes some friends. It starts off as few at first but the number gradually grows and grows,\nand his friends help him to develop into a better person. Sometimes Takashi will revisit something from his past, it may be a person who hated him, or\none of the few people who treated him with kindness but every time he revisits these moments as a better person, it is unimaginably heartwarming. I\nwould just like to put this in perspective, I have never cried in an anime. I have been sad, certain animes have definitely made me depressed but I\nhave never cried. For this anime to make my first anime tear a tear of joy, it had to do something special. On multiple occasions this show made me\ncry, it was never a depressing cry it was always a cry because of how heartwarming it was. The way that Takashi is able to come to terms with his past\nand live on really helps to show how he has grown up as a character and you have to admire the careful thought they put into each second of his\ndevelopment. In my opinion, the real strength of this anime is its character development. In Takashi’s case, there is no point where you can say “this\nis where he changed in this way”. It is a very slow but very obvious development, you won’t notice a difference between episodes but if you watch an\nepisode at the beginning of a season and one at the end it is as clear as day how he has grown. It makes every episode enjoyable as you watch it to\nsee exactly what Takashi will learn in any episode.That is what I think lets the show get away with its length. It is not a tense, nor emotionally\nhigh show to watch. You can watch this show over the course of a couple months and you still won’t get bored of it. It is simply a relaxing and\nheartwarming show to watch and you only need to watch one episode to put yourself in a fantastic mood. This show is like some anti-depression drug. If\nyou are feeling down and just want to be happy, cry a few tears of joy, and feel great about life then this show works perfectly. That is what i\nbelieve this show did right, and why it is so deserving of large runtime that it received. In my opinion this anime is fantastic, sure there are a few\nepisodes that I would consider to be just above par in direct comparison to others and the animation is only average but this show is simply\nbeautiful. It is by no means perfect but I would consider it a must watch for anyone who enjoys something that is truly heartwarming. As such I give\nit a 9/10.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>This reviews a review on the four current seasons as I feel that they should be combined into one reviewEvery once in awhile you get an anime with a very simple premise and very simple ambitions.

It had a very sub-par plot that did not captivate\nin the slightest, and didn’t use its clever comedy as much as it should have. When it was serious it was difficult to watch as it just felt so fake,\nhowever when it was funny, my god it was funny. When I was watching it I found myself struggling through the plot episodes just to get to the comedic\nones that came afterwards making the vast majority of the plot feel terrible. Now we have the sequel/spin-off Full Metal Panic Fumoffu which focuses\nprimarily on comedy, judging by how I liked the comedy in the original, this should be great. Is it?... Well, sometimes.I don’t think there has ever\nbeen a time before where I have experienced such highs and lows in an anime. Sometimes this show was brilliant and possibly the best humour I have\nseen in anime. The other times, through either cliche situations, or lackluster writing, fell far below the other episodes. I wanted to love this\nshow, and there were times when I definately did. However these times were few and far between. Episodes such as the rugby episode, or any of the\nBonta-kun episodes, were brilliant and some of the most fun you can have anywhere in anime. But in a twelve episode series, there are only four or\nfive that I would consider to be good. Unlike the first series, this show has next to nothing to do with war, mechas, or anything that Full Metal\nPanic is synonymous with. Instead this focuses on Sousuke’s and Kaname’s school lives, and while some of the “School Life” episodes were good, it was\nthe ones that broke this mold that were spectacular. Episodes that really involved something happening, rather than just dicking around in school were\nthe episodes that I really stuck around for. I think this is because of how I wanted Full Metal Panic to be, and what I was expecting of the franchise\nbefore I started to watch it. I thought I was going to get a mecha based comedy. I wanted to laugh while the action was unfolding. Rather than what\nFull Metal Panic actually was, which is extremely serious action briefly interrupted by light-hearted comedy. In a way I wanted both at once, rather\nthan one and then the other. After finishing Full Metal Panic I believed that the series would never get to do this, and left me questioning whether I\nshould actually keep watching.Surprisingly enough, there are episodes in Fumoffu that capture this situation, and gave me a true view of what this\nseries could have been, what I really wanted it to be. Some episodes do have some pretty good action, particularly when Sousuke pilots the greatest\nmecha ever invented, Bonta-kun, a kickass, bullet stopping teddy bear who can only communicate through various alterations of the sound “fumoffu”.\nWhen Bonta-kun appears, we get a perfect blend of kickass action, and laugh-out-loud comedy. This is when the series is at its best, with episodes\nthat are funny, and different from any other anime comedy I’ve seen. The comedy also causes one large problem, the lack of character development. Many\nof the characters in this show, the most important being Kaname, rely on those little moments to look deeper into their personalities and with that,\nmake them likeable characters. The original Full Metal Panic, as much as I disliked its plot, it was able to do this, and by the end of the show I\nliked Kaname as a character. Fumoffu is the exact opposite, as I counted three moments in the series that tried to make Kaname likeable, and one of\nthem failed in doing so. This show made me re-hate Kaname as a character as most of the time she comes off as abusive, stubborn, and rude. I had to\nask myself, why doesn’t this show have those moments? The answer is simple, because it is trying to be funny. It is trying to push a laugh out of you\nall the time and thus takes out the moments that make you like the characters, because let’s be honest, the funny part of Kaname is the abusive,\nstubborn, and rude part.The reason I really wanted to love this show is because when I first had it described to me, it sounded exactly like how I\nwanted the original Full Metal Panic to be. I had it described to me as a “more comedic take on Full Metal Panic”, this could not be farther from the\ntruth. I feel this to be more of a high school comedy that happens to include the characters from Full Metal Panic. It felt like it had nothing to do\nwith Full Metal Panic and all the problems from the original show just felt so far away.In fact, I don’t think I would have really minded a light plot\nsomewhere in Fumoffu. I know this sounds weird coming from the person that hated the plot in the original, but it’s true. I don’t think the plot to\nFull Metal Panic was bad because it was bad, I think it was bad because it was nowhere near as good as it thought it was. It didn’t realize the right\ntimes to stop being serious and would often keep a dark tone for episodes on end until it could be separated by a light-hearted funny episode which in\nthe end, just felt awkward. Fumoffu could have fixed this by using its comedy. If it had a very light plot, nothing too serious, just robots,\nexplosions, and the odd bit of character development. Combine this with the kooky comedy we have seen from these characters and we would have had\nsomething absolutely spectacular.I think I just dislike the Full Metal Panic franchise because it is not what I could see it being. If you want a high\nschool comedy with the characters of Full Metal Panic, then I could see how you would love this. The problem is, it did not have what I wanted to see\nin a comedic spin-off of the franchise. Full Metal Panic is synonymous to action and mechas, something we do not get from fumoffu. It lost what Full\nMetal Panic had to make room for dicking around at school, which while fun, was not what I could see this franchise being and as such, I can only give\nit a 7/10.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>The original Full Metal Panic was an anime that really did not recognize it’s own unique strengths.

When it was serious it was difficult to watch as it just felt so fake, however when it was funny, my god it was funny. When I was watching it I found myself struggling through the plot episodes just to get to the comedic ones that came afterwards making the vast majority of the plot feel terrible. Now we have the sequel/spin-off Full Metal Panic Fumoffu which focuses primarily on comedy, judging by how I liked the comedy in the original, this should be great. Is it?... Well, sometimes.I don’t think there has ever been a time before where I have experienced such highs and lows in an anime. Sometimes this show was brilliant and possibly the best humour I have seen in anime. The other times, through either cliche situations, or lackluster writing, fell far below the other episodes. I wanted to love this show, and there were times when I definately did. However these times were few and far between. Episodes such as the rugby episode, or any of the Bonta-kun episodes, were brilliant and some of the most fun you can have anywhere in anime. But in a twelve episode series, there are only four or five that I would consider to be good. Unlike the first series, this show has next to nothing to do with war, mechas, or anything that Full Metal Panic is synonymous with. Instead this focuses on Sousuke’s and Kaname’s school lives, and while some of the “School Life” episodes were good, it was the ones that broke this mold that were spectacular. Episodes that really involved something happening, rather than just dicking around in school were the episodes that I really stuck around for. I think this is because of how I wanted Full Metal Panic to be, and what I was expecting of the franchise before I started to watch it. I thought I was going to get a mecha based comedy. I wanted to laugh while the action was unfolding. Rather than what Full Metal Panic actually was, which is extremely serious action briefly interrupted by light-hearted comedy. In a way I wanted both at once, rather than one and then the other. After finishing Full Metal Panic I believed that the series would never get to do this, and left me questioning whether I should actually keep watching.Surprisingly enough, there are episodes in Fumoffu that capture this situation, and gave me a true view of what this series could have been, what I really wanted it to be. Some episodes do have some pretty good action, particularly when Sousuke pilots the greatest mecha ever invented, Bonta-kun, a kickass, bullet stopping teddy bear who can only communicate through various alterations of the sound “fumoffu”. When Bonta-kun appears, we get a perfect blend of kickass action, and laugh-out-loud comedy. This is when the series is at its best, with episodes that are funny, and different from any other anime comedy I’ve seen. The comedy also causes one large problem, the lack of character development. Many of the characters in this show, the most important being Kaname, rely on those little moments to look deeper into their personalities and with that, make them likeable characters. The original Full Metal Panic, as much as I disliked its plot, it was able to do this, and by the end of the show I liked Kaname as a character. Fumoffu is the exact opposite, as I counted three moments in the series that tried to make Kaname likeable, and one of them failed in doing so. This show made me re-hate Kaname as a character as most of the time she comes off as abusive, stubborn, and rude. I had to ask myself, why doesn’t this show have those moments? The answer is simple, because it is trying to be funny. It is trying to push a laugh out of you all the time and thus takes out the moments that make you like the characters, because let’s be honest, the funny part of Kaname is the abusive, stubborn, and rude part.The reason I really wanted to love this show is because when I first had it described to me, it sounded exactly like how I wanted the original Full Metal Panic to be. I had it described to me as a “more comedic take on Full Metal Panic”, this could not be farther from the truth. I feel this to be more of a high school comedy that happens to include the characters from Full Metal Panic. It felt like it had nothing to do with Full Metal Panic and all the problems from the original show just felt so far away.In fact, I don’t think I would have really minded a light plot somewhere in Fumoffu. I know this sounds weird coming from the person that hated the plot in the original, but it’s true. I don’t think the plot to Full Metal Panic was bad because it was bad, I think it was bad because it was nowhere near as good as it thought it was. It didn’t realize the right times to stop being serious and would often keep a dark tone for episodes on end until it could be separated by a light-hearted funny episode which in the end, just felt awkward. Fumoffu could have fixed this by using its comedy. If it had a very light plot, nothing too serious, just robots, explosions, and the odd bit of character development. Combine this with the kooky comedy we have seen from these characters and we would have had something absolutely spectacular.I think I just dislike the Full Metal Panic franchise because it is not what I could see it being. If you want a high school comedy with the characters of Full Metal Panic, then I could see how you would love this. The problem is, it did not have what I wanted to see in a comedic spin-off of the franchise. Full Metal Panic is synonymous to action and mechas, something we do not get from fumoffu. It lost what Full Metal Panic had to make room for dicking around at school, which while fun, was not what I could see this franchise being and as such, I can only give it a 7/10. </p>","likesCount":1,"progress":null,"rating":14,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1628","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1628"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1628/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1628/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"6760","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6760/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:44:55.328Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"kids-on-the-slope","synopsis":"Introverted classical pianist and top student Kaoru Nishimi has just arrived in Kyushu for his first year of high school.

But here’s the thing, I just love saying that I love this show. It is weird that I love this show so much as\nwell, because out of all the shows I watched in the Spring 2012 season, this was the one that I was closest to dropping. Which leads me to say that\nthis is not a perfect show, it does have some flaws that I will get to, but regardless of these faults, it is spectacular. The setting was the major\nselling point when I heard about this show, and by setting I don’t mean the place because that is not interesting in the slightest. What is\ninteresting however is the time period. This takes place during a time that is never explored in anime, and if it has been, I have not heard about it.\nSakamichi no Apollon takes place in Japan during the 1960’s. I know Japan is kind of an overused setting when it comes to anime, but this show\nportrays such a setting in a completely different manner. I personally found it refreshing to see such a take on a popular location. The plot itself\nfocuses around Kaoru Nishimi, a high-school boy who is also an excellent pianist, after certain events took place, he was forced to move in with his\nextremely wealthy relatives. On his first day at his new school he ends up meeting Sentaro, your stereotypical delinquent/nice guy who we find out is\nan excellent drummer. He also meets Ritsuko, a cute, nice, and friendly girl whom, big shock here, Kaoru falls in love with. We also have Junichi, the\nfather, or rather “brother” figure to Sentaro as his own father left while Sentaro was still fairly young and he didn’t have anyone to look up\ntowards, and Yurika, the women who Sentaro convinces himself he is in love with. Kaoru and Sentaro have a unique friendship that they develop through\nJazz in a basement owned by Ritsuko’s father.And as such we begin a fairly generic romance, but here’s the thing. I would not like to believe that\nthis show is really about the romance. Really it is about the friendship between Kaoru and Sentaro. I am still amazed they can convey a scene that is\nthe equivalent to a couple minutes of dialogue with a just a few songs. These “jam sessions” with Kaoru and Sentaro are the highlight of the show for\nme as just their playing is able to express their emotions perfectly, whether it be anger, hatred, love, reluctance, forgiveness, or just simple\nbliss. All of these emotions are conveyed perfectly through song, and I was excited every time one of these scenes popped up. In fact two of these\nscenes are absolutely brilliant and I really don’t want to talk about this as I would rather spoil the plot than spoil the pure happiness that is\ndelivered to me though these scenes.However, while the “bromance” section of this show is brilliant, the show tries to play itself off as a romance.\nThat means there are scenes that do try to convey a romantic theme, and more often than not, fall flat on their face in doing so. These romances don’t\nseem to be based off of anything and start to appear really out of nowhere. The Kaoru/Ritsuko romance is especially guilty of this later on, when it\nflops around for almost no visible reason. The romance section of the story also brings out Kaoru’s other personality, and by other personality I mean\nhis prick side. That is my biggest problem with Sakamichi no Apollon, Kaoru, our protagonist, is an asshole. He is selfish, judgemental, and quick to\naccuse others of trying to get rid of him. He is the kind of person that believes that his friends have to be around him constantly and if they move\naway from him one tiny bit, he attacks and insults them. As well, he also never really graduates from being a prick, there are times when you think\nthat he has finally learned his lesson, but then he goes on to find another thing to be an absolute prick about. Even in the final episode he has one\nof his largest prick moments when acts like a selfish, egotistical asshole. Even when he does act like this people seem to brush him off and forgive\nhim immediately afterwards, which I simply cannot understand.But, with that section, I have exhausted everything that I do not like about this show,\nbecause as I have said before, this show is excellent and there are many things that I found to let me forgive the faults. For starters, there is no\nfanservice to speak of in this show. Even the most subtle of fanservice techniques, the kind of thing that you have to be deliberately paying\nattention to find have no place in this show. This allowed me to treat the show for what it is, view the romance as a love story rather than clipped\ntogether scenes of the human body. In a way, it made the story feel a lot more real and was a refreshing aspect of the show compared to the troves of\nfanservice we find in anime today.As well I enjoyed the simplicity that came with this show. This show does not really have any dark themes to speak\nof. It does not have complex story or any crazy plot twists. I find a lot of plot based shows today try to see how much they can stuff into their\nseries, thinking that the more elements they have, the better it is. This show seemed to be packed with the right amount of elements, there was never\nreally a moment where you felt as if nothing at all was happening, and there wasn’t really a time where it felt like I was overloaded with\ninformation. The show was paced in such a way that just felt natural and fluid.On top of that the art is gorgeous, it is quite different from normal\nanime and feels quite a lot older but i felt that it complemented the themes of the show and the time period perfectly. The art is heavily airbrushed\nwhich complements the simplicity of the show excellently. The animation, while mostly good has a few moments where you can tell a lot more focus was\nput into them, when the animation picked up, it became perfectly fluid and had an excellent feel to it. It was kind of a shame that this only happened\nonce in awhile however as it made the other scenes feel slightly rushed in comparison. But then we move onto the music, it would be an absolute sin to\nmention this show without talking about the absolutely brilliant soundtrack that came with it. When I heard that an individual person was hired to\nplay each of the characters instruments in the jam sessions, I knew this was going to be something special. Not only that but none of this music was\nlicensed. Even the songs that do exist in real life were re-recorded and if you listen to the two side-by-side you can notice the clear difference\nbetween the two. Sometimes I even felt as if the Sakamichi no Apollon version was actually superior to the previous version. I can safely say that\nthis is my favourite anime soundtrack of all time, it was good music, wonderfully played, and perfectly used in the show.To reiterate, I love this\nshow. It has its obvious flaws, but it is petty compared to the things that were great in this show. That being said, it was easily my favourite show\nof the season. It just felt so awesome to watch, I would wait a week, twiddling my thumbs waiting patiently for the next episode. This truly was a\ngreat show, and I hope to see more like it. It has faults, so I can only give it a 9/10 but I cannot hesitate to recommend this show to you. Oh, and\nbefore you get all upset that I didn’t give it a 10 seeing as I talked about how awesome it was, keep in mind I have only given two shows a perfect\n10, because that is what a 10 is, perfection. This still ranks as one of my top 10 anime.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>I love this show, and yes I know it sounds a little silly for me to start off saying that, and it would make the review more interesting if I revealed my love for it as you see the review.

This still ranks as one of my top 10 anime. </p>","likesCount":0,"progress":null,"rating":18,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1629","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1629"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1629/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1629/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"6734","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6734/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:44:29.667Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"tasogare-otome-x-amnesia","synopsis":"Seikyou Private Academy, built on the intrigue of traditional occult myths, bears a dark past—for 60 years, it has been haunted by a ghost known as Yuuko, a young woman who mysteriously died in the basement of the old school building.

Half the time it is a semi-dark romance that is wonderfully complemented\nby the heavily orange artstyle, and the rest of the time is a happy-go-lucky comedy. It switches between these two styles so erratically that it is\nimpossible to say if there was really a theme to the show. The plot follows Teiichi as he finds himself wandering in the deserted old section of his\nschool. He vaguely recalls a story in which a ghost haunts whoever looks in a certain mirror. Needless to say, he finds this mirror and looks into it,\nhe is definitely haunted, but not in the way you would suspect. The ghost is a surprisingly attractive girl named Yuuko. Yuuko has amnesia and Teiichi\npromises to help Yuuko get her memories back, as such he begins the “Paranormal Investigations Club” which is used to help Yuuko learn about her past,\nand how she died.What pisses me off is that this show opened up great, with one of the most clever opening episodes I have seen in a long time. This\nepisode had the ability to make the exact same scene infinitely more entertaining by changing a few details and airing it twice. As well we got\nintroductions to all the characters and leaves us with some important questions that need to be answered, needless to say this first episode was\nbrilliant, it had everything it needed and was supported by a wonderful art style that fit the style of show perfectly. After this episode I was\nhooked, thinking that this show was going to be amazing.From there on it just gets worse, instead of answering the questions we were left with, it\ndecides to launch a barrage of comedy episodes at us, whose only purpose is to make us laugh. It does this until episode eight in which it decides to\nswitch back to the theme that they were conveying in the first episode. These episodes finally began to answer the questions we had, I only felt that\nit was a little late. I had forgotten the questions we were left with due to the many comedy episodes before episode 8 so to finally get a plot now\nfelt a little dull. That being said, these episodes were good, and I would have really enjoyed them if they happened sooner, but sadly they didn’t.\nThe show seems to try and please everybody, it switches themes erratically in order to make sure that everybody has something they could enjoy. The\nproblem comes when this makes that you can’t enjoy every second of it, no matter what side of the fence you are on. If you want a upbeat comedy, then\nI am sure that you will enjoy episodes 2-7. However, you will feel that there is too much going on with the other episodes and that may turn you off.\nOn the opposite end, if you are looking for an emotional mystery/romance then you will be turned away by the series of episodes that blocks you from\nthis theme. These alterations in themes are no more prevalent than in the final episode, where I can only assume there was an argument over what the\ntheme really was. Usually an episode of the show sticks to its own theme and doesn’t really change it, but this episode alters the style it is going\nfor many times. It’s happy, then it’s melancholy, it proceeds to switch to a romantic theme, before switching to the emotional and bittersweet\nending... Except it would be the ending if it were actually the ending, but it’s not. In an unneeded twist it switches theme once more to a\nhappy-go-lucky comedy that we saw in episodes 2-7. This ending was simply weak, it was hard to tell which emotion it wanted me to feel and overall\nmade me feel none. If it had ended at the bittersweet part where it felt like a natural ending, then I would have been genuinely depressed and it\nwould have left a much larger impression on me. Similarly if it had skipped the bittersweet part and moved straight to the “everything is happy” part,\nI would have been laughing and smiling like an idiot. However, in the way that it toyed with my emotions it made it impossible for me to enjoy the\nending at all.All this said, there were a few episodes that I really liked, some of them were just enjoyable, and some experimented with the way that\nthey could show a story. Episodes 10 and 11 were my favourite episodes in the series, even above the opening episode. These episodes showed Niiya\nviewing Yuuko’s past through her own eyes. This was clever, and showed a unique art style that you don’t see in anime often. Because of the situation,\nthe entire episode was told from a first person point of view. We see life through one person’s eyes and this kept me intrigued throughout these\nepisodes. As well these episodes heavily played into the plot and finally answered the question that we all had from the very beginning, how exactly\ndid Yuuko die?I would also like to point out the art style, which works almost half the time. When it is a comedy it falls flat as the art style is\njust a bit too dark. However it really works perfectly when it goes for the supernatural mystery/romance tone. When this happens the art style\nperfectly complements the tone of the story and makes it much, much more enjoyable. I think it was the art style that made me want the darker side of\nthe story more as it just fit better. If the art style were to be adapted into something a bit more cheerful then perhaps I would have enjoyed the\ncomedy episodes the most.This anime is an anime that tries to be everything, but fails with deciding what it really is. It could have been really\ngreat if it had picked one theme and stuck with it. It did not and the plot and overall enjoyment suffered greatly because of this. The plot was\nintriguing and I was interested to find out what really happened, but it decided to put off the plot in favor of cracking some jokes.

If not please\nwatch Bakemonogatari first before watching or thinking about watching Nisemonogatari.I’ve always had mixed feelings about Bakemonogatari, I loved it\nfor its amazing art and its clever writing but I hated it for its... use of the female body. The fanservice in Bakemonogatari always walked a thin\nline between annoying and creepy and sometimes it was hard to tell which side it was leaning to. In the direct sequel, Nisemonogatari the series seems\nto have fallen off this line and face planted straight into the realm of creepy. In the first episode alone we get, mild incest, mild loli on two\noccasions, and full high schooler nudity. This ends up developing into legitimate incest, full loli nudity, and more boob shots that you can count.\nKoyomi, the protagonist ends up developing from a weird perverted teenager, into a terrifying, sister kissing, tooth brushing, child molesting creep.\nDo I hate this show, no. Could this show have been much, much better, yes.The weird thing about Nisemonogatari is that it starts off great. Koyomi is\nat a point where he is not too creepy to watch and we have none of the haunting incest. On top of that we have an interesting plot involving the only\ngood female character in the show, Senjougahara. This set of episodes is wonderful as we get a lot of insight into senjougahara’s past and why she is\nso distrustful of others. In fact, the first episode drew me in during the very first minute in which we have Senjougahara kidnapping Koyomi, only\nleaving us to wonder how this incident got started. From there we get a series of quite well thought out plot elements that bring more characters into\nthis mess and develops Koyomi’s relation with others quite well. The first seven episodes are called into motion when a mysterious, ill-omened man\nnamed Kaiki Deishu appears. Further development leads you to discover that Senjougahara had once sought this mans help in the events prior to\nBakemonogatari. She did this only to discover that he was a con-man who was only after her parents money and indirectly caused her parents divorce.\nShe decides that she must hunt down Kaiki and make him regret what he has done. It gets more complicated when Karen, Koyomi’s sister contracts a\nmysterious illness that was supposedly given to her by Kaiki himself. That is as much as I want to give away without providing major spoilers because\nthese first episodes are brilliant. The writing is engaging and clever, the characters and their motives, both clear and unclear are interesting, and\noverall it’s just fun. The first seven episodes were a complete blast to watch. Honestly, if it had ended at the end of the first arc, then I would\nhave loved this show. I would have placed it far above Bakemonogatari and possibly into my top ten, that is how much I liked the beginning. Sure there\nwas fanservice, but it was all pretty mild, and it wasn’t to the point where it was creepy. But it will get creepy, very soon.Episode 8, just\neverything about it just makes me ask “Why?” Why does this episode need to exist. It ruined such a good streak of great and thoughtful episodes with\none that can be summed up with one word, incest. In this episode we get one of the most disturbing scenes in anime. period. I will never, ever look at\na toothbrush in the same way again. I’m sure if you have been following anime of any kind for long enough you would have heard of this scene, in fact\nI heard about it well before I watched Nisemonogatari, in fact well before I watched Bakemonogatari for that matter. It is something that those who\nhave watched it will never be able to forget and will be prevalent in our nightmares for years, if not decades to come. This entire episode is creepy,\nit is not entertaining in the slightest, just creepy. I did not laugh, I was not pulled into the clever dialogue, I was simply disgusted. From there\non, it does get less creepy, but it is still creepy nonetheless. The image from episode eight is still in the back of your mind and we still have the\nincest, oh yes the incest. Koyomi seemed to realise that he has a taste for his sisters and wants some more, and will stop at nothing to get what he\nwants. As such, Koyomi has passed the realm of weird and passed into the realm of creepy and disgusting. Please note that these episodes after number\neight are not bad, they are just less mind blowing than what I saw before episode eight. These episodes still have an interesting plot, but it just\nseems less fun. Perhaps that is because they had a darker colour scheme for this section as a lot of it seems to take place after dark, but I never\ngot that feeling of “Wow, this is really cool”. While I am on the subject of colour schemes, I guess it would be a crime not to mention the art,\nbecause let’s be honest, that is the real reason we all started watching this. This anime, is gorgeous, more so than Bakemonogatari in my opinion.\nThis is due to one thing and one thing only, the set design. Words cannot describe how good it looks. It is a mix of surreal environments and abstract\nminimalism that makes you look at every scene in awe. The indoor environments are especially stunning that it sometimes causes you to stop looking at\nthe characters and at the backgrounds instead. Whether it be Koyomi’s house which looks like a cross between a hollywood set and a medieval church, or\nKaiki’s hangout which put me in a hypnotic trance just from looking at it. In fact I can safely say this is the only anime and will probably be the\nonly one in which there can be a scene of the protagonist taking a bath with me in awe of how beautiful it is. Not only that but they use the\nenvironments to convey the messages of the characters. This can range anywhere from road signs reading out characters emotions, to a small detail in\nthe environment relaying what happens in a scene. This pretty much forces you to pay attention and think more about the events that are unfolding.\nNisemonogatari may actually be the best looking anime I have ever seen.What it all comes down to is, do I like it? Well, yes but that does not mean I\nlove it. It could have been much better and even with the amazing visuals, the final half still creeps me out. The first half however is absolutely\nbrilliant and holds up the entire series. Overall, this show evens out to be completely meh. It is not as good as Bakemonogatari, though it is not\nmuch worse. It serves its purpose and as such gets a 7/10.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>I am writing this review assuming that you have watched Bakemonogatari prior to this and can remember the characters and their pasts. If not please watch Bakemonogatari first before watching or thinking about watching Nisemonogatari.I’ve always had mixed feelings about Bakemonogatari, I loved it for its amazing art and its clever writing but I hated it for its... use of the female body. The fanservice in Bakemonogatari always walked a thin line between annoying and creepy and sometimes it was hard to tell which side it was leaning to. In the direct sequel, Nisemonogatari the series seems to have fallen off this line and face planted straight into the realm of creepy. In the first episode alone we get, mild incest, mild loli on two occasions, and full high schooler nudity. This ends up developing into legitimate incest, full loli nudity, and more boob shots that you can count. Koyomi, the protagonist ends up developing from a weird perverted teenager, into a terrifying, sister kissing, tooth brushing, child molesting creep. Do I hate this show, no. Could this show have been much, much better, yes.The weird thing about Nisemonogatari is that it starts off great. Koyomi is at a point where he is not too creepy to watch and we have none of the haunting incest. On top of that we have an interesting plot involving the only good female character in the show, Senjougahara. This set of episodes is wonderful as we get a lot of insight into senjougahara’s past and why she is so distrustful of others. In fact, the first episode drew me in during the very first minute in which we have Senjougahara kidnapping Koyomi, only leaving us to wonder how this incident got started. From there we get a series of quite well thought out plot elements that bring more characters into this mess and develops Koyomi’s relation with others quite well. The first seven episodes are called into motion when a mysterious, ill-omened man named Kaiki Deishu appears. Further development leads you to discover that Senjougahara had once sought this mans help in the events prior to Bakemonogatari. She did this only to discover that he was a con-man who was only after her parents money and indirectly caused her parents divorce. She decides that she must hunt down Kaiki and make him regret what he has done. It gets more complicated when Karen, Koyomi’s sister contracts a mysterious illness that was supposedly given to her by Kaiki himself. That is as much as I want to give away without providing major spoilers because these first episodes are brilliant. The writing is engaging and clever, the characters and their motives, both clear and unclear are interesting, and overall it’s just fun. The first seven episodes were a complete blast to watch. Honestly, if it had ended at the end of the first arc, then I would have loved this show. I would have placed it far above Bakemonogatari and possibly into my top ten, that is how much I liked the beginning. Sure there was fanservice, but it was all pretty mild, and it wasn’t to the point where it was creepy. But it will get creepy, very soon.Episode 8, just everything about it just makes me ask “Why?” Why does this episode need to exist.

It lacks any form of wit and clever writing when it comes to its humour. It uses excessive\namounts of fanservice to attempt to get a laugh. But here’s the real problem, I loved it! It goes against all the rules for anime that I should like,\nand I hate myself for liking this, but the thing is, I just do. Somehow, with a combination of stupid writing, cardboard characters and over-the-top\nfanservice, it manages to do something special. Make me like something with stupid writing, cardboard characters, and over the top fanservice. I can’t\nreally explain why it works but I will try my hardest to explain. Our story follows a perverted highschooler. (Our hero!) Who seems to have the\nunnatural ability to make almost any girl want to fuck him. He is also a zombie. (Because apparently romance with a zombie is hip right now in Japan.)\nAs well he is joined by Tsundere, Tsundere-er, and Tsundere-est. Later he is joined by Tsundere 2.0 AKA, The Easy Button. With this one-dimensional\ngroup of a pervert and four Tsunderes they go to fight monsters and what-not. Why? Fuck, I don’t know.That’s the thing, these characters have no\ndepth. There is a little bit here in there, but with the exception of Eu AKA, Tsundere 1.0, we never get any insight to their personalities. I mean\nseriously, look at some of these characters. We have Haruna, she is a magical girl and a Tsundere... That is all. Then we have the Holy Grail of bad\ncharacters, Sera AKA, Tsundere-est. Her character is a vampire ninja. Yes, a fucking vampire ninja... What were they on when they made this? Her\npersonality, is a rock. A rock, with tits. Scratch that, a rock with tits who thinks the protagonist is a pervert, and rightly so. The writers seem\ncompletely aware of this as they introduce her with a lone that pretty much says she has no personality.Speaking of Tsundere-est’s tits, let’s talk\nabout the fanservice. which there is a lot of. It seems self aware of this too. It’s not like they are trying to sneak it past us for some attention.\nNo, they pretty much have a big sign that says, “we have tits, watch our show.” I mean, Tsundere-er is naked after she transforms out of her magical\ngirl transformation. The protagonist points this out blatantly, trying to call your attention to the screen by pretty much saying, “Hey look,\nTsundere-er is naked. Isn’t it neat?” This fanservice continues until the very end of the series, with the last episode ending with the entire cast in\nthongs. Really, is that really an acceptable way to end a series? With one giant fanservice explosion.Early in the plot, the protagonist ends up\nstealing Tsundere-er’s magical girl abilities and has to become a magical girl himself. Which calls in another form of low-wit humour, crossdressing.\nNot only does it creep you out, this plot point also makes for one of the most disgusting transformation sequences possible. I mean, it’s creepy\nenough when ribbons are tightly wrapping around a girls rear, but when it’s a dude, just... ugh. Also the protagonist seems to switch from being\ncreepy and perverted to being selfless and heroic and I really don’t know when he switches. He can be imagining other people thinking sexual thoughts\nabout him at one moment, and then saving the fucking day the next.But somehow, and trust me, I don’t know how, this show is hilarious. I’m trying to\nthink if there is an episode where I didn’t laugh out loud multiple times, somehow there isn’t. It is just so random that you can’t really help but\nlaugh. But matching the laughs equally are the disgusting moments. From the protagonist getting tentacle raped, to Tsundere-er getting tentacle raped.\nit is full of moments that just made me want to hurl. It’s gross and that is all, it is not funny, it’s completely repulsive in every way.Well then,\nif the comedy is weighed down by disgusting scenes, then it must be the plot that makes me like it. Well no luck there. This thing about this plot is\nthat it may have actually been good, I don’t know. You see, there are some points that are actually suspenseful and somewhat emotional... That is\nuntil the writers realize that they are being suspenseful and emotional and quickly remedy that with something completely stupid. Keep in mind this\nstupid stuff is funny, but it is used at a point which may have actually been interesting if it had not been included.Not to mention that this anime\nis gory as hell. Once again to the point where it disgusts me. Just because the protagonist is immortal, it does not mean that he has to become a\nfucking pincushion being torn limb from limb every bloody episode. and yes I meant bloody in the literal sense. This show has enough blood to rival\nBaccano!, but unlike Baccano! it is not the good kind of gore. It is the “why did you need to do that” kind of gore and frankly is something that the\nshow could have done without.I may have found why I like it, it is just so stupid and random. I mean, I like random shows, FLCL is one of my favourite\nshows of all time, but then again you can tell that some thought was put into it. It’s the way that this show is, it’s so stupid it’s funny. The fact\nthat the protagonist can get his arm cut off in a fight but can win the fight by whipping the loose arm at his enemy, it’s stupidly funny. The fact\nthat there is a restaurant called “Mask-donalds” where the staff is wearing luchadore outfits, is again stupid, but so stupid it’s funny. It’s funny\nin the same way that a video of someone falling on a bike is funny. It’s stupid, it has no substance or wit, but that kid just fell off a fucking\nbike, you’re gonna laugh. That’s the thing you do not need to think while watching this show, providing you have the sense to completely turn off your\nbrain then this show becomes absolutely hilarious. However, if you are looking for substance, turn away now.And there we go, I just wrote a review\nabout a show I liked without actually saying that I liked about it. It’s gory, disgusting, poorly written, with a jumbled and messed up plot. It is a\ntrainwreck on all accounts but I just can’t stop myself from laughing at it. As such I give it a 7.5/10. Why? Because I just feel like it and\nhonestly, I had hoped that writing this review would lead to discover why I liked it. However, it just lead me to more confusion. Maybe it’s because\nit is random, maybe it’s some other weird phenomenon. Sadly I don’t think I’ll ever know.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>This may just be the stupidest thing that I have ever seen.

The only thing that felt original were the character designs, which were a blend of\nWestern and anime styles.\n\n**Plot:** Whoever thought of trying to adapt 17 volumes of manga in 12 episodes needs to be fired. Things happened far to fast. One thing after\nanother was thrown at the viewer with the only breaks coming when there were fights. Most of the plot twists were predictable and the ones that\nweren't have little effect because we haven't been given time to care about the characters. Even a terrific plot is underwhelming if you don't care\nabout what happens, and this was not a terrific plot to begin with. I did find two plot twists enjoyable, but generally you are not suppose to find a\ntragic reveal or psychological breakdown *enjoyable*.\n\nThe one positive is the ending which was concrete and tied everything up. It left room for a sequel if the producers want to make one, but it doesn't\nneed it. It feels complete as it is.\n\n**Characters:** The most notable aspect of the characters were their designs. They looked like a blend of Western and anime styles. On the plus side,\nthey were unique and help *Zetman* feel even more like a typical superhero comic.

Seeing one of the characters fall to pieces and go crazy was what I enjoyed most through the\nentire anime. That's a bad sign. I'm suppose to be lamenting the lose of this character, not taking delight in it.\n\n**Barriers:** <u>Gore:</u> *Zetman* is rated mature for a good reason. Every fight was blood soaked, many characters died painful deaths, and there\nwas even a brief sex scene thrown in for good measure. If you're not comfortable with gore, *stay away*. \n\n<u>Sexism:</u> This is my largest problem with *Zetman*. The issue isn't that there were no badass women. The issue is that not a single woman did\nsomething productive. All of the female characters were either a love interest, a mother figure, or a hostage. There wasn't a single female\nscientist, or a business woman, or anything like that. When female characters were taken as hostages (which happened a surprising number of times),\nnone of them did anything to try to save themselves. They would just wait for someone (ie. a man) to come along and save them. I don't expect my\nentertainment to be the pinnacle of social equality, but I do expect it to not insult me. The sexism made some episodes hard, uncomfortable, and\ninsulting to watch.\n\n**Special Mention:** <u>Atmosphere:</u> One of the few things *Zetman* has going for it is the atmosphere it sets up. The city looked dirty, old, and\nharsh. There were far more shadows than lights, and who knows what could be lurking in the shady alleyways. The gritty ambiance gave the show an even\nlarger Batman feel.\n\n**Overall: 1/10** An extremely rushed plot, characters the viewer is given no time to care about, lots of blood, and sexism make it impossible for me\nto recommend *Zetman* to anyone. An entertaining, complete ending and the ambiance somewhat redeem it, but they're nowhere near enough. If you're\nlooking for some good horror, go watch *Hellsing Ultimate*, *Deadman Wonderland*, or *Another*; not *Zetman*.\n\nThis review was originally posted at http://radiantserenechaos.deviantart.com/art/Anime-Review-Zetman-328007192\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p> <b>Originality:</b> There aren't many superhero anime, so I'm sure <i>Zetman</i> is a unique series to the Japanese.

But after that, the plot\ntends to move slowly until it lurches forward. This can make for a bumpy ride. When it does move forward, the plot twists are good, intriguing, and\nmake sense (ie. don't come out of left field). The lagging between twists feels dull, but it's needed.

However, a second season is not\nlooking like a strong possibility, so I'm afraid this is another case of non-manga readers being screwed over. (In a vaguely related point, read the\nmanga if you enjoyed the anime. It's just as good and goes farther. It was also recently license by Kodansha, so it'll be coming out in English\nsoon.)\n\n**Characters:** The main character, Chihiro Furuya, is far from the best main character I've seen, but he's also far from the worst. He does one\nnotable, very douchy thing, but other than that he's a well meaning, realistic character. He's designed to look cat like (especially in chibi form)\nwhich I find strangely cute, but others have found off-putting. Rea is very easy to sympathize with, and you can't help but root for her. The other\ncharacters are likable enough, with the exception of the antagonist, whom we are suppose to dislike. You'll have no trouble telling who is who,\nbecause every character's design and personality are distinct from each other.\n\n<b>Barriers: </b>Fanservice: When debating whether to watch this, the greatest deterrent to me was all the sites listing *Sankarea* as an ecchi and\nfanservice show. While there is the occasional bathing or changing scene, the series hardly deserves the label of ecchi. Virtually all of the obvious\nfanservice is limited to promotional art and chapter covers (which have little to do with the anime anyway). Except for those with almost no tolerance\nfor sexual fanservice, most anime fans should find little here that is overly off putting.\n\nHorror: *Sankarea* is about zombies, so obviously there's going to be some horror elements, but it is usually more lighthearted. It doesn't venture\ninto it's darker elements very often. When it does get around to the horror, it's not overly graphic, but graphic enough that some caution should be\nexerted. I would suggest the squeamish stay away, but you could watch this if you don't mind some blood once in a while.\n\n<b>Special Mention: </b>Tone: *Sankarea* is a black comedy. It has darker elements but usually feels lighthearted. Black comedy is something that's\nvery hard to do, with disastrous consequence if not done well. *Sankarea* doesn't balance them well in many scenes, but it's not as bad as it could\nbe. As a horror fan, I would have liked more gore, but I have a feeling I'm the minority. Most would probably be content with the tone.\n\n**Overall: 6/10** Enjoyable and above average quality wise, but far from a masterpiece.\n\nThis review was originally posted http://radiantserenechaos.deviantart.com/art/Anime-Review-Sankarea-313687765\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p> <b>Originality:</b> It's not hard to find the pieces of <i>Sankarea's</i> concept in other things.

Though it’s well\nworth mentioning that more then just this change is captured well; Brina Palencia gives a sense of playful regality to Holo which perfectly reflects\nher character as one to not act without thought nor having thought out what to do when acting, even in the most serious of situations. Though her\nmannerisms also play a welcome role in defining Holo’s character, flicks of a tail and ear flops speak more then words ever could and this is carried\nover to other elements to.

And while I can applaud the decision to try and stem high\nrisk scenarios from a source other then gratuitous violence, I can’t deny the fact that generally, I just found the proceeding’s of these stories\ndull. Their pacing is more at home on the medium that S&amp;W was originally written for but in a TV show spread out over a number of episodes they\nloose their appeal.\n\nTo an extent, these stories do serve a purpose quite well because they allow us to see more from the main characters.

None of these characters are massively deep in any way and nor are they voiced in a\nway to write home about, and it’s unfortunate to say it, but even for a world that holds quite a bit of potential, it doesn’t really have anyone else\nto show for that fact, and it’s a real downer considering how well things are handled else were. \n\nAnother problem with said finance battles is that they primarily take place in city’s and the art work for the city’s is a place were the budget of\nS&amp;W is quite present, for the most part, the streets are rather empty giving an almost convenient lack of life to the environments. This is\nexcusable given how much time it takes to animate a crowd, but the problem really stems from the streets themselves. If you go into any urban\nenvironment you will immediately notice a lack of coherence between structures, building heights and widths vary here and there and each architect’s\nown style can be seen adorning each building with love. S&amp;W doesn't really capture this not nearly well enough to give the cities a sense of\nvibrancy in amongst the chaos of urban living, the repeated vanishing point perspectives and rather dull straight edges that are pretty common give\nthe setting an almost sterile feel to them that really doesn't lend its self well to the setting or show considering the length of time that is spent\nin said cities. \n\nIt’s worth noting though that the country side backgrounds are generally an exception to the rule and do remain pleasing enough to the eye throughout\nthe show’s duration.\n\nAnimation is unfortunately another area where the show suffers from it’s budget, while expressions look nice enough most of the time, and the\naforementioned mannerisms are lovely, for the most part the character art and the character animation is below par and rather choppy.

As the story progresses both Yuno and Yukkii are\ndragged into this epic tournament that offers the winner the ultimate prize of becoming God.\n\nWhile its not the best anime ever made, it tells a very pure and heartfelt story, portrayed by funny romantic moments, as well as its share of\nepic/gory battles and painful tearjerking scenes. Its not perfect, but it puts on a fair fight.\n\nStory 9 - A love story, for the most part. We get to see the characters get closer to each other, change for each other and make sacrifices for each\nother. It comes with its own share of twists and turns, and im going to go ahead and say you will not see that coming. The story is very, very clever\ncompared to pretty much most anime ive watched, and still manages to contain that love theme throughout. It show just how much you would be able to do\nfor someone you love. When it explains it all in the end it makes use of quite a few scenes shown as flashbacks, showing how its clever and\nunpredictable, but never unfair or hard to grasp. I did not give this a full score because i expected the conclusion to be more loyal to the manga,\nand not so ambiguos.\n\nArt 8 - Some of the scenes are stunning, others lacking. Both the indoor and outdoor environemts are varied, and there are quite a few locations to\nenjoy. Characters are exceptionally well made, with emotion clear in their faces, and the animations are top notch. A full score was not given,\nthough, since some environments and effects are poor, and a few characters look awkward.\n\nSound 10 - Another strong point. While i was not impressed with the opening or ending credits, i quite enjoyed the soundtrack. Turns out there are\naround 60 songs, and all of them are quite good and portraying emotions. The sadder compositions were exceptionally well made, in my opinion, and i\nmanaged shed a few tears in some scenes, be that from the amazing growth and development or profound sadness.\n\nCharacter 10 - Characters were quite unique as well. It's impossible not to feel some sort of attraction towards the lead female Yuno, or some sort\nof pity for the pathetic Yukkii. But that's only in the first few episodes. The character growth, you see, is amazing. Yuno shows quite a few colors,\nand Yukkii mans up turning himself into quite the respectable lead character. Some of the less-important ones, like Ninth, Seventh, Hinata or Akise\nwere amazing too, and had quite the back story to them, showing how they are not put on the back seat just because we only see them a few times.\n\nEnjoyment 9 - The anime is quite enjoyable. I watched it 3 times, from start to finish and still felt as though it was my first time. Some scenes, if\ni recall a sad one on the hospital and an epic battle on the roof, were so amazing i re-watched them 10-20 times over.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Mirai Nikki is a love story of sorts, following Yukkii, a pathetic loner who thinks of himself as a bystander and does nothing to interact with the society around him, and Yuno, a gorgeous, stalker who for God knows what reason has a crush on him.

My thoughts? H2O: Footprints in the Sand is like a less-popular Clannad.Potential Spoilers may follow. Level of spoilers\nis medium-low.Story - 7:Sometimes hard to understand. I spent a few episodes wondering what they were really doing. Basically, Hirose is a transfer\nstudent living with his uncle. He's been blind for…forever, imagine, and needs to depend on everyone to help him. One day, he meets a girl called\nKohinata Hayami, who is ostracised and bullied by everyone in the town. He befriends her despite this, but ends up falling over when she is taken away\nfor a thorough beating. Otoha, the spirit of time (what, magic?), grants him sight, and from there, he uses his newfound ability to help people in\norder to prove that he isn't helpless and use his life for good. Through the series, we meet many characters who help to form an expectation. The\nbackstory of the two female leads is slowly developed in literally 5-second flashbacks every few episodes, and isn't discussed often. Instead, the\nshow focuses on the relationships between the main characters and hints at something greater midway through. The story of this anime came in little\nbites, but could've been handed to us faster to make more sense. It was like they tried to add more horrible pasts to characters to make it more\ninteresting. Art - 7: Throughout the series, the art style seems to change a little. Not in the way the characters are drawn, but in some of the\ndirection of them. At the start, it was all sharp fringes and everyone looked very similar. In some of the episodes, the characters were standing in\nlate afternoon light, and softer colours and lines appeared. There's nothing you haven't seen before, but it's not so bad. Animation is also\nsmooth. Sound - 7:Giving the series a seven for sound. I didn't really like the opening theme, and always quit the show when it ended. The songs\ndon't really stick in my memory, but they weren't bad, I just wasn't interested. There was one, though, about episode 6-ish where Hinata is having\na flashback. That was a good song.Character - 8:In this anime, we have six important characters, but only three of those are the main focus--Kohinata,\nHinata and Hirose. These characters are quite well developed, but I found issue in how the protagonist behaves. Hirose was blind his entire life, and\nfeels helpless to fight back. However, when he is given the chance to fight back and stand up for his friends, he squanders it by allowing himself to\nbe dominated by the rest of the girls in the group. \"Don't talk to the cockroach, or you will be cockroach Hirose!\" (paraphrasing) Hirose struggles\nto be a stronger person and help, as (I imagine), years of blindness has rendered him dependent on everyone else. In any case, Hirose was a good\nprotagonist for a short series like this.Hayami is a strong character (and my favourite) because she has had to endure endless hardships from every\nmember of the town. She takes everything as it comes and has completely accepted who she is. When the chance for change, appears, we see that Hayami\nstill has the capacity to hope and experience happiness. Unfortunately, when she was happy, she ended up being like all the other girls in her\nbehaviour. As the series progresses, she accepts Hirose's friendship, but still turns out to be a serious girl who is considerate and introverted.\nFinally, Hinata was well developed throughout the anime. She starts as a model student, but out of school, she is quite controlling. We see how she is\nled by her family's words, and how she resorts to increasingly desperate measures to stop Hirose from helping the outcast. As hard as she tries, she\ncannot stop being submissive and her desperation overflows. As much as they all fight it, the main characters of the series have a strong sense of\njustice and together form strong bonds through friendship. Enjoyment - 8:Nobody can deny the ease of watching a series only 12 episodes in length.\nIt's simple, quick and the episodes just flow into one another. I enjoyed traipsing through each episode, and craved the scenes where Kohinata showed\nup.Overall - ~7:This anime was okay. I didn't like the fanservice -- honestly that was unnecessary in an anime that feels like it's darker under the\nsurface. Music wasn't catchy, story was stilted, but the animation and characterisation were developed well.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Forgive my amateurish review. My thoughts?

Maybe I'm just a simpleton who doesn't\ncatch on fast enough. But it did made it interesting and fast-paced. You have all of these multiple countries and they consider how one decision will\naffect everybody else. They have alot of characters. And couple of different storylines rolled up into one. Some of the characters even look the\nsame(this is what really got me confused). But I liked how all of the storylines seemed to tie together. It was all new and nothing seemed cliched.\nThey way they attack and the way they do things all seemed new to me. Which I liked.Art - 10I thought the art looked good. Everything look beautiful\nand crisp. The backgrounds were nice and all the characters looked really good.Sound - 8The OP was good and I enjoyed it. It was catchy and had a nice\nbeat to it. The ED was nothing speacial but was still good. The backgroud music to me was non-exsistent. I never once noticed it. So I thought that it\nkinda lacked in that department. Although 'Horizon's' singing made my day. I love every bit of that song. Characters - 8These were new types of\ncharacters to me. And trust that doesn't happen to often. After seeing plenty of anime you kinda feel that you'll never meet a character that\ndoesn't remind you of another. And I can honestly say Aoi Tori (the hero of our story) reminds me of no one. He's just a likeable, perverted, boob\ngroping, hilarious, naked dancing, erotic game playing boy that makes you smile everytime you see him. But when you mention 'Horizon' he seems to\nbeome serious without even changing that goofy smile on his face that I love so much. 'Horizon' (the heroine of our story) is a very quiet person.\nShe's not shy or anything she just doen't talk much. Mainly because of the fact that......... lets just say, she's a 'robot' but at the same time\nshe not, for the sake of our storyline. All of the other characters are fun and entertaining.

Shuffle was the 4th anime I had ever seen(school days being first, boy was that a\nmistake, and a few really ecchi ones). I came in looking only at the romance factor and the 18 and over rating. What I got on the other hand was an\nanime that would forever live in my \"Hall of Fame\" animes so to speak.Story - 7 The story was unexpected, and that I believe made it even more\nmagnificent. Prior to this I had seen titles like Omamori Himari, Kiss X Sis, and HOTD. They were animes that didn't lack a story line, but didn't\nhave a suprising or \"hanging-on-the-edge-of-your-seat\" story line that Shuffle! has. It made me realize that anime isnt just big boobs and panty\nshots. I also like the fact that its all HUMAN emotions. The drama, the romance, the joy that they all experience is all realistic and I could easily\nsee it happening in real life(except the whole angel demon thing). I also re-watched it and LOVE the fact that he choses a girl in the end.

Shuffle was the 4th anime I had ever seen(school days being first, boy was that a mistake, and a few really ecchi ones). I came in looking only at the romance factor and the 18 and over rating. What I got on the other hand was an anime that would forever live in my \"Hall of Fame\" animes so to speak.Story - 7 The story was unexpected, and that I believe made it even more magnificent. Prior to this I had seen titles like Omamori Himari, Kiss X Sis, and HOTD. They were animes that didn't lack a story line, but didn't have a suprising or \"hanging-on-the-edge-of-your-seat\" story line that Shuffle! has. It made me realize that anime isnt just big boobs and panty shots. I also like the fact that its all HUMAN emotions. The drama, the romance, the joy that they all experience is all realistic and I could easily see it happening in real life(except the whole angel demon thing).

It would be unwise-stupid- to not watch Clannad first. After\nStory builds upon everything Clannad achieved to make it an even better and angelic experience. The plot is magnificent with the right amounts of\ndrama, comedy and tragedy, the visual quality is wonderful and the voice acting and songs are mesmerising. If you didn’t enjoy Clannad, you may\nactually enjoy After Story since it is in almost every way superior. If you did enjoy Clannad, then by no means watch this and feel more feels. After\nStory will most likely break your heart into pieces before mending it and breaking it again, it is the very definition of a rollercoaster of emotions.\nIt is nothing short of an amazing experience that transcends almost all media. There will be minimal spoilers in the following review. No big and\nmajor events will be described to avoid people getting spoiled, or people reliving such experiences. Clannad After Story is a direct sequel to the\nadored Clannad series (or season, which ever you call it) setting straight after the warm ending in Clannad. After Story continues to follow the story\nof Tomoya, as he matures personally and with his relationship with Nagisa. The series is roughly cut in half, the earlier half finishing off their\ntime in school and the latter, delving into their adult life. At high school, it is their final semester as they continue to help out their friends in\ntheir struggles. But when the transition occurs, from the sheltered life in school to the big open world, a tragedy occurs. Nagisa falls ill again,\nlong enough to keep her from graduating with Tomoya. As Nagisa retakes her third year at school again, Tomoya finds a stable job and is able to find a\nsmall house for the two. As time moves on, and Nagisa finally graduates (after falling ill again), the true family matters of the Clannad series\nbegins to occur. Tomoya marries Nagisa and is intent to start a family. But the truth is, is this very man who cursed and hated this town ready to\nstart a family in it?Avoiding major spoilers aside, Clannad After Story is a continuation of Clannad. All the characters are there, those characters\nthat didn’t have their own personal arc in Clannad have theirs in AS (I’ll refer to this series as that from now on in the review). As we reach the\nend of high school for Tomoya, we evidently see his growth from an ignorant child who plays tricks and sarcastic remarks, to a more mature person who\nsympathises and cares. The entire Clannad experience continues to shine in AS with more hard hitting arcs and further developed relationships. As we\nsee Tomoya grow up and mature alongside Nagisa, we can’t help to feel their genuine emotions as time moves on. It’s that very foundation of how we can\nrelate to these characters, to be able to feel their expressions and actions, that the messages and motifs that AS delivers are hard hitting and in\nsome cases, life changing. We get to see Tomoya interact more with adults, begin to work to provide food and shelter for his family to ensure their\nsafety and happiness. One thing that AS does better than Clannad, is that the pacing of the story is much better and seamless. The arcs do not outpace\neach other and feel short as a result, but feel complete. That is pretty much the sense you get from AS, that the entire story is complete. AS\ncompletely builds upon the first series, enhancing the experience to a further degree by placing emphasis on the relationships you built with the\ncharacters. The general plot still places emphasis on Tomoya, with the first half still engaging with him helping out his friends and the second half,\nfully experiencing the notion of family. And this is where the entire experience boils down to, the emphasis on family. It may be strange how the main\nfocus is only fully feature in the latter half of AS, but the latter half is arguably better than the first series. There are a few new characters\nthat join the Clannad cast, one of which will be one of the biggest in the latter half. As Clannad magnificently blended comedy and tragedy together\nso does AS, and much better too. AS features a more mature theme and plot than Clannad and may feel very heavy and serious at times. That is how many\ncomedic events do occur every now and again, and these moments are sheer flashes of brilliance. The comedic moments never feel tacked on; they are\nwell executed and will get a laugh out of many. AS is also much more dramatic than the first, with the emphasis on a more mature story there are bound\nto be dramatic moments that may plague an adult’s life. In these dramatic instances, there is no over the top melodramatic crap that seems stupid or\nunbelievable. The same can be for the tragic moments that are a real tear jerker. These tragic moments (not to spoil about, or make people remember)\nare much more powerful in AS than Clannad, since we have travelled and related with the characters over the course of over 20 episodes. It is pretty\nmuch a stab in the heart when something tragic occurs to one of your favourite characters. It is because you build a real strong relationship with the\ncharacters and when something ever happens to them, you feel for them. That’s pretty much the gist of the anime’s strength, on how real these\ncharacters and events are. They can occur in real life. Throughout the entire Clannad experience, you get to see the characters grow and develop and\nfeel attached to them. While Clannad focused lightly on family and more on development and characters, the latter half of AS features the theme of\nfamily dominantly. We get to see Tomoya forgive his father after years and years of pain and suffering, we see Tomoya marry Nagisa to start a family\nand have a little girl of their own, and we get to see how important family is to a person. To Tomoya, Nagisa was the only thing he ever cared for in\nthe town, he hated it immensely. Of course things change over time and we see him develop further into a family man and a fatherly figure. One of the\nbiggest moments for him is to realise his father’s mistakes and hardships, and to forgive him for it. Tomoya is mature enough to see the past he\ncouldn’t before, and for that he has become a better man. While he does find great happiness with the birth of his daughter, it does come with a great\nprice. And when too the child faces the same price, we go back to the first words spoken in the entire series- how things change over time. As Nagisa\nonce said: “Things always have to change. Fun things…Happy things…But eventually they will change. Even so, can you continue loving this place?”\nThings do indeed change and for Tomoya, it is the biggest quote of his life. But as things do turn into a ditch, and how tragic and miserable events\noccur to Tomoya; “Surely you’ll find new fun and happy things”. From the parental care of Ushio Okazaki, the forgiving of his father, or his thought\nof turning away at the bottom of the hill, Tomoya still manages to find something new and happy. If anything, it is the moral of the story and the\nmeaning you take out of it, the love of family and the cherishing of the people around you. It’s that heartwarming moral that completes the story and\nmakes you feel all fuzzy inside. The illusionary world is finally revealed in AS, but not in the way you would like it to. The cold empty world with\nthe last lonely human and a robot is finally revealed. It is nothing more than what Key does; add a magical element to the story. At the climax of the\nstory, that world finally has a purpose, but is not explained rather well. If there is any fault with the entirety of Clannad and AS, is the execution\nof the illusionary world. Its purpose as well may not be clear, and the purpose itself may leave a sour taste in a few people’s mouth. I too wouldn’t\ncare if the illusionary world did not exist in the story, reverting the ending to a more tragic and miserable ending. But that doesn’t fit with the\nthemes or meaning of Clannad. If the original ending were true, it would tell the tale of a boy who tries to change himself for the better, but each\ntime he does he fails. The true meaning of Clannad is family, relationships and mature character development, and if a magical element is needed to\nfully express and tie up the series- then by all means let it happen. Also, in turn the sad ending would not have given any closure at all for\neveryone watching, so the existence of the illusionary world may still be debatable but its purpose in the plot can be justified.Clannad never\nsuffered from any visual flaws and neither does AS. As the plot is built upon Clannad, so are the visuals. Some of the backgrounds are amazing to look\nat. The night time city backdrop or the exposing stars in the sky all add to the surrealism of the anime. Another thing done extremely well is the\nanimations. At one point in the series, there is a fight between Tomoya and another person. That fight is done magnificently. Not that the fight was\nepic or with big flashing attacks, but the movement and the actions of the two are fluid and realistic. The characters in the fight move fluidly and\nthrow punches like they would in real life. If anything, that fight alone can be in anyone’s top fighting scenes, not purely for its action and\nepicness, but for its fluidity and realism. The rest of the anime also evokes real and fluid animation. Colours are once again a big usage in AS,\ninducing a more highlighted experience. From the funny sunflower field to the pink blossoming sakura trees, the colours used in AS are nothing short\nof a strong story telling device.The audio is once again another major positive point in the series. Still using the same tracks straight from the\nvisual novel, the soundtracks used adds more than just background noise. The very tracks are used so well in time with the scenes that the song can\nidentify key moments in the anime. From the simple piano tune of Nagisa’s theme playing in some of the most important moments throughout the series,\nto the light hearted tune of Two Idiots, the soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece. Even through the indication of the song, you can identify\nwhich moments may be leading up. Or through listening to the songs, those moments that the songs fit in perfectly with start to fly into your head. In\nconjunction with the great visual and plot aspects of the anime, the soundtrack adds a whole other level that surpasses anything your emotions can\nhandle. It is truly the composition of Jun Maeda- the composer of the visual novel’s soundtrack- that we can experience a masterpiece of an\nexperience. The voice acting itself is once again done magnificent.In Clannad, for me, the opening is nothing special while the ending was, it is the\nopposite for me in AS. The opening title is Toki wo Kizamu Uta and is composed by non-other than Jun Madea. Sung by Lia, the song itself is nothing\nshort of touching and amazing. The lyrics themselves completely fit in with the anime and express the anime fully well. Not only are the lyrics\ntouching and heartwarming, the music composition reinforces its idea. And Lia herself is such a great singer, and her with Jun Madea music is such an\namazing combo. The visuals that accompany the song is also well done. The entire notion of the opening is expressed so well through the combination of\nboth. This opening is one of my all time favourites. The ending for AS can’t be said the same, it doesn’t represent the anime at all. The ending is\nall happy and carefree and especially with the more mature themes present in AS, it doesn’t bode well. In Clannad the ending music may leave a\ndistaste after a sad event, but the ending here just completely ruins the mood and mindset of viewers. The ending for AS is bad, it just doesn’t fit\nin with anything. It is a shame since the opening is done masterfully. To sum up my review, Clannad After Story is one masterpiece. It completely\nbuilds upon Clannad and does everything better. While the illusionary world isn’t unfolded in the best way, the entirety of the plot is based upon the\ntheme of family. The characters and relationships once again are strong and real. Throughout AS, there will be many feels and tear jerking moments, as\nwell as comedic moments that don’t feel bad or tacked on. The music is once again some of the best works in anime, working well with the anime’s theme\nand reasoning. The visual quality is never faltered, and the pacing of the story is done much better. The opening is magnificent and the ending is\nbad. The entire anime is done perfectly. VerdictClannad After Story is beyond amazing. It is one of the finest works in all media that is able to mix\nand blend both a coherent and amazing story with great visuals and a masterful soundtrack. The story is told marvelously and focuses on mature themes.\nWe get to see characters develop into mature people, form relationships that last a lifetime and form a family that is the most important. The theme\nof family is completely relatable to everyone, and with it being the most focused idea, it is touching to say the least. After Story is a\nrollercoaster of emotions with a masterpiece soundtrack that heightens the experience altogether, it goes beyond being just an anime and becomes a\ndivine experience. It creates such an emotive story at such a high caliber that is rarely seen in, well possibly all media. This may be a super tall\nclaim, but this anime does indeed create such a strong and emotive connection between you and the characters, definitely creating a rollercoaster of\nemotions in this slice of life. There are happy and joyous moments, moments of great hilarity, moments that pull heartstrings of raw affectionate\nemotions, and moments of crushing tragedy. If you wish to live, breathe and feel in a world filled with everything your heart could implode from, this\nanime is recommended for you. Tissue boxes are a necessity.After Story is as perfect of an anime it can get, the entire experience is heartwarming and\ntouching. It is by little means the best, but one of.10/10\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Recommendation: Clannad After Story is a continuation from the original Clannad anime.

To Tomoya, Nagisa was the only thing he ever cared for in the town, he hated it immensely. Of course things change over time and we see him develop further into a family man and a fatherly figure. One of the biggest moments for him is to realise his father’s mistakes and hardships, and to forgive him for it. Tomoya is mature enough to see the past he couldn’t before, and for that he has become a better man. While he does find great happiness with the birth of his daughter, it does come with a great price. And when too the child faces the same price, we go back to the first words spoken in the entire series- how things change over time. As Nagisa once said: “Things always have to change. Fun things…Happy things…But eventually they will change. Even so, can you continue loving this place?” Things do indeed change and for Tomoya, it is the biggest quote of his life. But as things do turn into a ditch, and how tragic and miserable events occur to Tomoya; “Surely you’ll find new fun and happy things”. From the parental care of Ushio Okazaki, the forgiving of his father, or his thought of turning away at the bottom of the hill, Tomoya still manages to find something new and happy. If anything, it is the moral of the story and the meaning you take out of it, the love of family and the cherishing of the people around you. It’s that heartwarming moral that completes the story and makes you feel all fuzzy inside. The illusionary world is finally revealed in AS, but not in the way you would like it to. The cold empty world with the last lonely human and a robot is finally revealed. It is nothing more than what Key does; add a magical element to the story. At the climax of the story, that world finally has a purpose, but is not explained rather well. If there is any fault with the entirety of Clannad and AS, is the execution of the illusionary world. Its purpose as well may not be clear, and the purpose itself may leave a sour taste in a few people’s mouth. I too wouldn’t care if the illusionary world did not exist in the story, reverting the ending to a more tragic and miserable ending. But that doesn’t fit with the themes or meaning of Clannad. If the original ending were true, it would tell the tale of a boy who tries to change himself for the better, but each time he does he fails. The true meaning of Clannad is family, relationships and mature character development, and if a magical element is needed to fully express and tie up the series- then by all means let it happen. Also, in turn the sad ending would not have given any closure at all for everyone watching, so the existence of the illusionary world may still be debatable but its purpose in the plot can be justified.Clannad never suffered from any visual flaws and neither does AS. As the plot is built upon Clannad, so are the visuals. Some of the backgrounds are amazing to look at. The night time city backdrop or the exposing stars in the sky all add to the surrealism of the anime. Another thing done extremely well is the animations. At one point in the series, there is a fight between Tomoya and another person. That fight is done magnificently. Not that the fight was epic or with big flashing attacks, but the movement and the actions of the two are fluid and realistic. The characters in the fight move fluidly and throw punches like they would in real life. If anything, that fight alone can be in anyone’s top fighting scenes, not purely for its action and epicness, but for its fluidity and realism. The rest of the anime also evokes real and fluid animation. Colours are once again a big usage in AS, inducing a more highlighted experience. From the funny sunflower field to the pink blossoming sakura trees, the colours used in AS are nothing short of a strong story telling device.The audio is once again another major positive point in the series. Still using the same tracks straight from the visual novel, the soundtracks used adds more than just background noise. The very tracks are used so well in time with the scenes that the song can identify key moments in the anime. From the simple piano tune of Nagisa’s theme playing in some of the most important moments throughout the series, to the light hearted tune of Two Idiots, the soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece. Even through the indication of the song, you can identify which moments may be leading up. Or through listening to the songs, those moments that the songs fit in perfectly with start to fly into your head. In conjunction with the great visual and plot aspects of the anime, the soundtrack adds a whole other level that surpasses anything your emotions can handle. It is truly the composition of Jun Maeda- the composer of the visual novel’s soundtrack- that we can experience a masterpiece of an experience. The voice acting itself is once again done magnificent.In Clannad, for me, the opening is nothing special while the ending was, it is the opposite for me in AS. The opening title is Toki wo Kizamu Uta and is composed by non-other than Jun Madea. Sung by Lia, the song itself is nothing short of touching and amazing. The lyrics themselves completely fit in with the anime and express the anime fully well. Not only are the lyrics touching and heartwarming, the music composition reinforces its idea. And Lia herself is such a great singer, and her with Jun Madea music is such an amazing combo. The visuals that accompany the song is also well done. The entire notion of the opening is expressed so well through the combination of both. This opening is one of my all time favourites. The ending for AS can’t be said the same, it doesn’t represent the anime at all. The ending is all happy and carefree and especially with the more mature themes present in AS, it doesn’t bode well. In Clannad the ending music may leave a distaste after a sad event, but the ending here just completely ruins the mood and mindset of viewers. The ending for AS is bad, it just doesn’t fit in with anything. It is a shame since the opening is done masterfully. To sum up my review, Clannad After Story is one masterpiece. It completely builds upon Clannad and does everything better. While the illusionary world isn’t unfolded in the best way, the entirety of the plot is based upon the theme of family. The characters and relationships once again are strong and real. Throughout AS, there will be many feels and tear jerking moments, as well as comedic moments that don’t feel bad or tacked on. The music is once again some of the best works in anime, working well with the anime’s theme and reasoning. The visual quality is never faltered, and the pacing of the story is done much better. The opening is magnificent and the ending is bad. The entire anime is done perfectly. VerdictClannad After Story is beyond amazing. It is one of the finest works in all media that is able to mix and blend both a coherent and amazing story with great visuals and a masterful soundtrack. The story is told marvelously and focuses on mature themes. We get to see characters develop into mature people, form relationships that last a lifetime and form a family that is the most important. The theme of family is completely relatable to everyone, and with it being the most focused idea, it is touching to say the least. After Story is a rollercoaster of emotions with a masterpiece soundtrack that heightens the experience altogether, it goes beyond being just an anime and becomes a divine experience.  It creates such an emotive story at such a high caliber that is rarely seen in, well possibly all media. This may be a super tall claim, but this anime does indeed create such a strong and emotive connection between you and the characters, definitely creating a rollercoaster of emotions in this slice of life. There are happy and joyous moments, moments of great hilarity, moments that pull heartstrings of raw affectionate emotions, and moments of crushing tragedy. If you wish to live, breathe and feel in a world filled with everything your heart could implode from, this anime is recommended for you. Tissue boxes are a necessity.After Story is as perfect of an anime it can get, the entire experience is heartwarming and touching. It is by little means the best, but one of.10/10 </p>","likesCount":26,"progress":null,"rating":20,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1657","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1657"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1657/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1657/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"1962","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1962/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:31:07.511Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:22:45.493Z","slug":"clannad","synopsis":"Tomoya Okazaki is a delinquent who finds life dull and believes he'll never amount to anything.

It boasts in a quality plot with an emphasis on the relationships between the\ncharacters. This never felt like a harem and has little to no fan service. There are many hilarious moments but equally as many tragic moments. A\ntissue box is also recommended. If you want a straight up slice of life that seems real, relatable and mature, this is for you. If you want a go happy\non rails anime, this isn’t your best choice but I’m not stopping you.Clannad’s premise tells the tale of Tomoya Okazaki, a 3rd year student at\nHikarizaka Private High School. Despite being at the school for three years, he hasn’t befriended much people and has earner the title of a\ndelinquent, being late many times and skipping classes. His only friend is Youhei Sunohara, a fellow delinquent and class clown. One day on the way to\nschool Tomoya met a girl (Nagisa Furukawa) at the bottom of the hill; speaking about how happy moments don’t last. Whether this is a destined meeting\nor not, Tomoya’s life is about to change. A new transfer student aiming to become student president, a silent girl hidden amongst knowledge, a weird\ncherry girl with a starfish, and more embracing friendships with his current friends. Clannad primarily focuses of Tomoya’s interactions with his\nfriend, their relationship with him and his personal growth.One of the biggest strengths of the anime is its ability to tell a story, and boy what a\nstory. The over-arching plot follows Tomoya and Nagisa’s attempt to act out a play. The plot focuses on Tomoya’s evolving relationship with Nagisa,\nand also on the other relationships between him and the other characters. The plot itself is very consistent with barley any plot holes and only minor\nproblems with pacing. The story plays with emotions constantly and becomes a rollercoaster of emotions. This is the typical method Key adopts to keep\nplayers interested in the game and characters. The moment you meet a character it becomes light hearted and humorous then the next moment it gets\nserious and sometimes tragic. For the most part the anime keeps its humorous aspect and sometimes you question how after some heavy plot twist and you\nare still able to laugh off to some stupid action by Youhei. It somehow manages to still give you a laugh throughout the entire series it is the\nexperiences that are shared between the characters that build on upon the plot and the overall theme. One of the biggest differences from previous Key\nadaptations is that Clannad is a much more mature story with more mature and complex characters. The tragedies that unfold are indeed mature, and for\nthat I think it is a much better plot. The mature themes further develop a much deeper story and this too creates a more relatable experience and a\nhighlighted personal response. It does at times get inspirational since many of these problems are relatable. I guess since it tackles more mature\nthemes, such as death and self-blame, it becomes a much better anime for it. It’s just that there is so much that makes the characters human and the\ninteractions between them much more interesting and real.The anime is split up into multiple arcs, which primarily focuses on one specific character.\nThe arc builds up the characters, indulging in the backstory of the character and their evolving relationship with Tomoya. There have been a few\nconsistencies with the arc lengths, some only lasting a measly few episodes and one lasting about seven. Of course pacing should be an issue when\nadapting a visual novel, since there is so much to cover within a limited frame, but Kyoto Animation- Kyoani for short- has done a good job trying to\npace well. Though there are those small issues with the arc lengths, since the shorter arcs mean less development for that character and their\nimportance to the overall plot may seem misplaced. The anime may have a somewhat slower start in its first arc but it is just as effective as the\nother arcs. Each arc places much empathises on each of the main characters whom play a big role in the overall plot of helping Nagisa in performing\nher play. With the relationships being so important, having distinct and interesting character is a must need. Character development is one of the\nstory’s most important aspects. Thankfully, all the characters are unique and have characteristics of all shapes and sizes. Tomoya himself is not the\nusual delinquent, usually speaks in a somewhat sarcastic tone to make a mockery of others for his own benefit. His daily monologues are enjoyable and\nbring out a witty and hilarious tone to the serious. Despite all this, Tomoya still acts in a very mature way and still has well intentions to try and\nhelp people, but usually in his own way. This all contrasts with Nagisa’s personality, which is as pure as it can be. She in fact loves the dango\ndaikazoku (big dumpling family) which aired in the past as a happy and cute family. She likes to hold old fashion values such as the strong\nrelationship between the family members, which leads ultimately to happiness. She is usually seen as a weak minded person, usually being gullible to\nTomoya’s antics and ploys. But, there are many times throughout the series that shows her personality growing as she eventually gets closer to Tomoya.\nBut as with Tomoya, she likes to help others, but usually right until the end in a more moral and understanding nature. This contrast between the two\ncharacters creates some interesting chemistry and plentiful interesting situations. Not only is their relationship important, but it affects both of\nthem in major ways. Well get to see Tomoya grow from an ignorant child who cares for himself towards a more grown and mature person, all thanks to\nNagisa. Their relationship affects each other quite a lot over time, showing their growth is something we all like to see and believe. All the other\ncharacters are just memorable, and to say so myself, quite attractive. Not in the sense of physical beauty, but their personalities are attractive.\nWell, I guess their looks are also attractive. The cast is filled with many personalities; from a cute small girl with a starfish that is arrogant to\na cool and calm girl, with womanly qualities and is strong both physically and mentally. It really helps when we learn much about their backstory\nduring their specific arc. Since it was adapted from a visual novel, where possibly every girl you meet can become a potential partner, each character\nin the anime would go so well with Tomoya. Since the story is told from his view, we get to know what he thinks, what he feels and essentially live as\nhe does. I will not go into further detail with the characters but they are so relatable, which makes us get somewhat emotional. It would be wrong if\nyou didn’t finish the anime without a new favourite character. Whether it’s the lovable Fuko, cool and calm Tomoyo, smart and shy Kotomi, the ever so\ntsundere Kyou or the imouto Mei. Nagisa’s parents too, get a mention since they are so kind and rather cool. Sanae Furukawa, the mother, is an\ninnocent mother who bakes bread for their business and usually runs away crying due to her bread skills being rather bad. Though, she is super\nsupportive for Nagisa and Tomoya’s relationship. Akio Furukawa is father everyone wants. He is funny, cool and overall awesome. But his most\nhighlighting trait is being a father. He does get serious when protecting his daughter and takes extreme measures to make sure she is happy. From\nhiding skeletons in the closet (figuratively) to openly supporting her in the time of need, Akio is one great and loving father.A major emphasis of\nthe plot is placed on relationships, and this focus of building relationships allows us to connect and relate to the characters, to feel what they\nfeel and mimic what they do. The main relationship is between Nagisa and Tomoya, and through that we can see and understand their past experiences\nthrough their interactions. Many past experiences are rather tragic but in time have a content outcome with the help of Tomoya and Nagisa. Another\nrelationship that is profound and relative is between Tomoya and his father. This is quite a common relationship in the real world, a distant\nrelationship where they won’t even acknowledge each other despite living in the same house. Of course, this affected the both of them in many ways but\nas I said before this is common in the real world. Tomoya and Youhei have a friendly relationship between each other but Tomoya usually takes the\nmickey out of Youhei just for fun. With the other main girls, the relationship is at its peak tension during their arcs, since it is primarily focused\nbetween Tomoya and that character. But due to the nature that the anime must follow one route, the romance between those characters and Tomoya is\nnever explored. Nor does it need to, since there is a sense of relief and completion to know that their troubles have been solved. Previous Key\nadaptations by Kyoani have been done in a somewhat immature way, when compared to this, and the relationship factor isn’t as strong. It also doesn’t\nhelp how many magical elements play a major role in their story. Not to say that there isn’t any magic at work in Clannad, since the Illusionary World\nis a prominent reoccurring idea. This Illusionary World appears every now and again and features a small robot and a little girl (the only human)\nliving in a sad world. This is the play that Nagisa acts out in the end. How she knows the story of the Illusionary World is a mystery, and so is the\nIllusionary World itself. Not much is revealed about this world and how it ties into the story, but it’s there… I guess. It is a somewhat desolate\nplace that adds another tragic theme to the story. Of course if you do want answers, watching the next series Clannad After Story is what you want.\nKyoto Animation have been known for some top notch animation. Nothing that can be defined as the best, but they have done some really solid visual\nrepresentations. Though, all the character designs are based on the visual novel they are done very well and with good taste too. The characters have\ndistinct features that differentiate themselves from each other, and this is before the big moe character explosion. Fan service is pretty much\nnon-existence since it serves no purpose (like it ever did) especially in this relationship based anime. The usage of colours is apparent throughout\nthe series; even in the beginning of the first episode a large colour contrast between Tomoya’s inner monologue about his hatred towards the town, and\nhis first interaction with Nagisa. The screen goes from a monochrome purple to flashes of bright colours where they’re surrounded by Sakura trees. The\nentire anime likes to show sakura trees in general. So, colour plays an important part in the story and also in the Illusionary World where things\nseem desolate and dull. The backgrounds are all done well and the animation seems rather smooth and fluid.The original visual novel doesn’t have any\nvoice acting so finding the right voice actors/seiyuus is vital to express the correct emotions and gestures. Kyoani has done a magnificent job in\nfinding the correct people and the voices are all done with full effect. The entire cast does a great effort and may even give shivers in the right\nsituation. The cast contains some pretty well known seiyuus such as Mai Nakahara (Working!) and Yuuichi Nakamura (Ore no Imouto). They all convey\ntheir characters effectively and have no annoying voices that pierce your back.One of Key’s biggest strength in their visual novels is their music.\nComposed by Jun Maeda, all composed tracks and songs are so brilliantly well done. The anime takes all the tracks from the visual novel’s soundtrack\nand apply them wonderfully in scenes. From the simple yet elegant tune of Nagisa’s theme to the sorrow and complex theme of the Illusionary World;\nIllusions, it is without a doubt that the music further enhances the emotive scenes throughout the series, playing at the right time complementing the\nscene’s portrayal. The songs are well memorable and so are the scenes that play with them. Even when searching through YouTube for a particular track,\nall the memories, the actions and emotions come rushing back. That is the effect the music has on you, it is just that amazing. Most of the soundtrack\nis composed of melodies only, and is usually played on the piano but some of the more complex pieces are more orchestral in a sense. To me, the\nopening credits of the anime aren’t anything too spectacular. I guess I get turned off by the song but the video itself is well done and has some\nforeshadowing. The opening isn’t too memorable, but what is, is the ending credits. Dango Daikazoku. This song follows the Nagisa theme and has a\nvocal track over it. It is deemed as the official song of the anime, since in the background are the cute Dango dumplings hopping around. The ending\nmay seem so innocent and cute, with a very catchy rhythm and rather cute lyrics, but since many tragic scenes are played towards the end of episodes\n(as cliffhangers); the song recalls all those sad moments and essentially the entire experience of watching Clannad for the first time. The ending\nsong now will recall all the memories once you finish, that simple tune will give you shivers and all these feels.Clannad isn’t your typical slice of\nlife anime. It focuses on what is important in any good media, plot. The character development and the relationships are done very well that not only\ndo they grow on you and you grow on them… somehow. The plot may have some arc length issues and maybe a couple pacing problems but the overall plot\npackage is so well done that negligible damage is dealt. The anime visually looks pleasing, as most Kyoani anime production do. The anime has some of\nthe best tracks around, all thanks to Jun Maeda’s wonderful composing abilities. The songs are unforgettable and show a ton of emotions that is\nexperienced throughout the series. You get very attached to the characters and it is sad to see them go once you finish the anime. But then again,\nthere is Clannad After Story.Verdict: Clannad is an amazing piece of anime, with some amazing characters, character development, mature themes and an\noutstanding soundtrack. There are a couple minor issues with the arc pacing but is just very minor. This anime is for anyone who wants to have a wild\nemotive ride, that resonates with real life and see how inspirational and emotional you can get. Slice of life fans will indeed enjoy this, and I do\nrecommend any otaku to watch this. If you want this review summed up horribly into a scoring system (which I don’t like)9/10\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Recommendation: Clannad is not your typical slice of life anime.

The over-arching plot follows Tomoya and Nagisa’s attempt to act out a play. The plot focuses on Tomoya’s evolving relationship with Nagisa, and also on the other relationships between him and the other characters. The plot itself is very consistent with barley any plot holes and only minor problems with pacing. The story plays with emotions constantly and becomes a rollercoaster of emotions. This is the typical method Key adopts to keep players interested in the game and characters. The moment you meet a character it becomes light hearted and humorous then the next moment it gets serious and sometimes tragic. For the most part the anime keeps its humorous aspect and sometimes you question how after some heavy plot twist and you are still able to laugh off to some stupid action by Youhei. It somehow manages to still give you a laugh throughout the entire series it is the experiences that are shared between the characters that build on upon the plot and the overall theme. One of the biggest differences from previous Key adaptations is that Clannad is a much more mature story with more mature and complex characters. The tragedies that unfold are indeed mature, and for that I think it is a much better plot. The mature themes further develop a much deeper story and this too creates a more relatable experience and a highlighted personal response.  It does at times get inspirational since many of these problems are relatable. I guess since it tackles more mature themes, such as death and self-blame, it becomes a much better anime for it. It’s just that there is so much that makes the characters human and the interactions between them much more interesting and real.The anime is split up into multiple arcs, which primarily focuses on one specific character. The arc builds up the characters, indulging in the backstory of the character and their evolving relationship with Tomoya. There have been a few consistencies with the arc lengths, some only lasting a measly few episodes and one lasting about seven. Of course pacing should be an issue when adapting a visual novel, since there is so much to cover within a limited frame, but Kyoto Animation- Kyoani for short- has done a good job trying to pace well. Though there are those small issues with the arc lengths, since the shorter arcs mean less development for that character and their importance to the overall plot may seem misplaced.  The anime may have a somewhat slower start in its first arc but it is just as effective as the other arcs. Each arc places much empathises on each of the main characters whom play a big role in the overall plot of helping Nagisa in performing her play. With the relationships being so important, having distinct and interesting character is a must need. Character development is one of the story’s most important aspects. Thankfully, all the characters are unique and have characteristics of all shapes and sizes. Tomoya himself is not the usual delinquent, usually speaks in a somewhat sarcastic tone to make a mockery of others for his own benefit. His daily monologues are enjoyable and bring out a witty and hilarious tone to the serious. Despite all this, Tomoya still acts in a very mature way and still has well intentions to try and help people, but usually in his own way. This all contrasts with Nagisa’s personality, which is as pure as it can be. She in fact loves the dango daikazoku (big dumpling family) which aired in the past as a happy and cute family. She likes to hold old fashion values such as the strong relationship between the family members, which leads ultimately to happiness. She is usually seen as a weak minded person, usually being gullible to Tomoya’s antics and ploys. But, there are many times throughout the series that shows her personality growing as she eventually gets closer to Tomoya. But as with Tomoya, she likes to help others, but usually right until the end in a more moral and understanding nature. This contrast between the two characters creates some interesting chemistry and plentiful interesting situations. Not only is their relationship important, but it affects both of them in major ways. Well get to see Tomoya grow from an ignorant child who cares for himself towards a more grown and mature person, all thanks to Nagisa. Their relationship affects each other quite a lot over time, showing their growth is something we all like to see and believe. All the other characters are just memorable, and to say so myself, quite attractive. Not in the sense of physical beauty, but their personalities are attractive. Well, I guess their looks are also attractive. The cast is filled with many personalities; from a cute small girl with a starfish that is arrogant to a cool and calm girl, with womanly qualities and is strong both physically and mentally. It really helps when we learn much about their backstory during their specific arc. Since it was adapted from a visual novel, where possibly every girl you meet can become a potential partner, each character in the anime would go so well with Tomoya. Since the story is told from his view, we get to know what he thinks, what he feels and essentially live as he does. I will not go into further detail with the characters but they are so relatable, which makes us get somewhat emotional. It would be wrong if you didn’t finish the anime without a new favourite character. Whether it’s the lovable Fuko, cool and calm Tomoyo, smart and shy Kotomi, the ever so tsundere Kyou or the imouto Mei. Nagisa’s parents too, get a mention since they are so kind and rather cool. Sanae Furukawa, the mother, is an innocent mother who bakes bread for their business and usually runs away crying due to her bread skills being rather bad. Though, she is super supportive for Nagisa and Tomoya’s relationship. Akio Furukawa is father everyone wants. He is funny, cool and overall awesome. But his most highlighting trait is being a father. He does get serious when protecting his daughter and takes extreme measures to make sure she is happy. From hiding skeletons in the closet (figuratively) to openly supporting her in the time of need, Akio is one great and loving father.A major emphasis of the plot is placed on relationships, and this focus of building relationships allows us to connect and relate to the characters, to feel what they feel and mimic what they do. The main relationship is between Nagisa and Tomoya, and through that we can see and understand their past experiences through their interactions. Many past experiences are rather tragic but in time have a content outcome with the help of Tomoya and Nagisa. Another relationship that is profound and relative is between Tomoya and his father. This is quite a common relationship in the real world, a distant relationship where they won’t even acknowledge each other despite living in the same house. Of course, this affected the both of them in many ways but as I said before this is common in the real world. Tomoya and Youhei have a friendly relationship between each other but Tomoya usually takes the mickey out of Youhei just for fun. With the other main girls, the relationship is at its peak tension during their arcs, since it is primarily focused between Tomoya and that character. But due to the nature that the anime must follow one route, the romance between those characters and Tomoya is never explored. Nor does it need to, since there is a sense of relief and completion to know that their troubles have been solved.  Previous Key adaptations by Kyoani have been done in a somewhat immature way, when compared to this, and the relationship factor isn’t as strong. It also doesn’t help how many magical elements play a major role in their story. Not to say that there isn’t any magic at work in Clannad, since the Illusionary World is a prominent reoccurring idea. This Illusionary World appears every now and again and features a small robot and a little girl (the only human) living in a sad world. This is the play that Nagisa acts out in the end. How she knows the story of the Illusionary World is a mystery, and so is the Illusionary World itself. Not much is revealed about this world and how it ties into the story, but it’s there… I guess. It is a somewhat desolate place that adds another tragic theme to the story. Of course if you do want answers, watching the next series Clannad After Story is what you want. Kyoto Animation have been known for some top notch animation. Nothing that can be defined as the best, but they have done some really solid visual representations. Though, all the character designs are based on the visual novel they are done very well and with good taste too. The characters have distinct features that differentiate themselves from each other, and this is before the big moe character explosion. Fan service is pretty much non-existence since it serves no purpose (like it ever did) especially in this relationship based anime.  The usage of colours is apparent throughout the series; even in the beginning of the first episode a large colour contrast between Tomoya’s inner monologue about his hatred towards the town, and his first interaction with Nagisa. The screen goes from a monochrome purple to flashes of bright colours where they’re surrounded by Sakura trees. The entire anime likes to show sakura trees in general. So, colour plays an important part in the story and also in the Illusionary World where things seem desolate and dull. The backgrounds are all done well and the animation seems rather smooth and fluid.The original visual novel doesn’t have any voice acting so finding the right voice actors/seiyuus is vital to express the correct emotions and gestures. Kyoani has done a magnificent job in finding the correct people and the voices are all done with full effect. The entire cast does a great effort and may even give shivers in the right situation. The cast contains some pretty well known seiyuus such as Mai Nakahara (Working!) and Yuuichi Nakamura (Ore no Imouto). They all convey their characters effectively and have no annoying voices that pierce your back.One of Key’s biggest strength in their visual novels is their music. Composed by Jun Maeda, all composed tracks and songs are so brilliantly well done. The anime takes all the tracks from the visual novel’s soundtrack and apply them wonderfully in scenes. From the simple yet elegant tune of Nagisa’s theme to the sorrow and complex theme of the Illusionary World; Illusions, it is without a doubt that the music further enhances the emotive scenes throughout the series, playing at the right time complementing the scene’s portrayal. The songs are well memorable and so are the scenes that play with them. Even when searching through YouTube for a particular track, all the memories, the actions and emotions come rushing back. That is the effect the music has on you, it is just that amazing. Most of the soundtrack is composed of melodies only, and is usually played on the piano but some of the more complex pieces are more orchestral in a sense. To me, the opening credits of the anime aren’t anything too spectacular. I guess I get turned off by the song but the video itself is well done and has some foreshadowing. The opening isn’t too memorable, but what is, is the ending credits. Dango Daikazoku. This song follows the Nagisa theme and has a vocal track over it. It is deemed as the official song of the anime, since in the background are the cute Dango dumplings hopping around. The ending may seem so innocent and cute, with a very catchy rhythm and rather cute lyrics, but since many tragic scenes are played towards the end of episodes (as cliffhangers); the song recalls all those sad moments and essentially the entire experience of watching Clannad for the first time.  The ending song now will recall all the memories once you finish, that simple tune will give you shivers and all these feels.Clannad isn’t your typical slice of life anime. It focuses on what is important in any good media, plot. The character development and the relationships are done very well that not only do they grow on you and you grow on them… somehow. The plot may have some arc length issues and maybe a couple pacing problems but the overall plot package is so well done that negligible damage is dealt. The anime visually looks pleasing, as most Kyoani anime production do. The anime has some of the best tracks around, all thanks to Jun Maeda’s wonderful composing abilities. The songs are unforgettable and show a ton of emotions that is experienced throughout the series. You get very attached to the characters and it is sad to see them go once you finish the anime. But then again, there is Clannad After Story.Verdict: Clannad is an amazing piece of anime, with some amazing characters, character development, mature themes and an outstanding soundtrack. There are a couple minor issues with the arc pacing but is just very minor. This anime is for anyone who wants to have a wild emotive ride, that resonates with real life and see how inspirational and emotional you can get. Slice of life fans will indeed enjoy this, and I do recommend any otaku to watch this. If you want this review summed up horribly into a scoring system (which I don’t like)9/10 </p>","likesCount":2,"progress":null,"rating":18,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1658","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1658"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1658/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1658/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"1474","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1474/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:23:34.075Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"boku-no-pico","synopsis":"Upbeat and effeminate Pico is working at his grandfather's coffee shop, Café Bebe, for the summer.

Vampires. I say that\nyou're right, but if you watch or read Vampire Knight, you'll find out that it's more than only ''vampires''. Let's start with the beginning.\n\nVampire Knight revolves between Yuki, Zero and Kaname. Yuki and Zero are Cross-Academy's prefects (guardians). It's their duty to prevent the\ncontact between the Day and the Night-class, even through it's very hard for them because all the girls from the Day-class have a big crush on the\nguys from the Night-class, that's not very rare because everyone in the Night-class looks gorgeous. Why are prefects needed? To prevent the Day-class\nof finding out the secret from the Night-class, in reality, all of them are vampires. The ''leader'' of the Night-class is Kaname Kuran, the one\nwho saved Yuki's life when she was little. Ofcourse he's a vampire too and the most powerful of all, a pureblood. Yuki and Zero both live with the\nchairmain of Cross-Academy, Cross Kaien. Yuki doesn't have any memories from when she was a kid, her memories begin on the day that Kaname saved her\nfrom a vampire. Kaname asked the chairman to look after her, and he did. The same goes of Zero, a couple of years later he comes to live with Yuki and\nthe chairmain to, after his parents where killed by a vampire.\n\nWhat is so loveable about all this? Both the anime and the manga have a mysterious feeling to it, that you know that something is going on but you\ndon't know what. You'll also notice and the story gets ''darker'' each time, and that the characters change. It takes a while until you really\nunderstand everything because they tell you the story bit by bit, you may also expect some big changes, I warn you. I wish that I could tell you more,\nbut I don't want to spoil it for you guys. I really recommend you guys both the manga and the anime.\n\nAnimation - \\[8\\]  \nWell, the animation. I must say that it's alot better than I expected. Still, I know that alot of manga-fans might be dissapointed. The manga might\nhave better art, but I think that the anime is really well made. They put alot of effort in this, and with succes. If the manga didn't excist, the\nanime would probably get higher ratings. Well, my opinion is that that the Vampire Knight anime is a good adaptation to the manga, I really think so.\n\nSound - \\[9\\]  \nThe sound, or better said, the music. The songs that the picked for both the opening and ending where really the right choice for this anime. Futatsu\nno Kodou to Akai Tsumi is the opening-song, sung by ON/OFF, and I really love it. It really matches the anime and gives you the Vampire\nKnight-feeling. I really like it. Then, for the ending-song, Still Doll sung by Wakeshima Kanon, was the biggest plus-point for me. I just loved it\nthe first time that I heard it! How come? It's mysterious and matches Vampire Knight perfectly. When you listen to it, I'm sure that you'll also\nget the feeling that there's something that you don't know yet. For the soundeffects in this anime, I have nothing to complain. When you needed one,\nyou got one, just how it is in real life. The good sound in Vampire Knight made it realistic.\n\nCharacter - \\[10\\]  \nHa, this was a easy one. The characters, you'll absolutely love them when you get to know them! What is good about this is that you don't only get\nto know Yuki, Zero and Kaname, but also the other people from the Night-Class and other random characters. Let's take Aidou as an example, he's not\na main character, still, you know exactly who he is! I'll tell you something about the 3 main characters now.\n\nYuki - I think that you all know her type of character, but Yuki is not the typical ''shoujo'' heroine. No, she's different. You can see that she\ntries her best to help Zero and get a place in his heart, she really cares alot for others, which might also be her weakness. To save Zero from\nturning into a Level E, she let him drink her blood. Yuki was attacked as a little girl by a vampire who was fallen to a Level E, and than was saved\nby Kaname. She has no memories of her parents or who she really is. Because Kaname saved her, she has a great affection for him, and she trusts the\nvampires in the Night-Class.\n\nZero - He might look like a cold-hearted guy in the beginning, but he really isn't. Zero's family where killed by a vampire, that's why he really\nhates vampires, all of them. Anyway, in the beginning of the series you'll see him in pain a couple of times, I think alot of you got the picture\nback then. Yes, when he was attacked he was biten by a vampire, a pureblood. Since he didn't die he will slowly turn into a vampire himself. Since\nhis huge hate for vampires, she fights against the progress with all his might. Zero always has a gun with him, he can use it to kill vampires. He\nalso has a younger twin-brother named Ichiru, but he was not as healthy as Zero (no, he didn't die).\n\nKaname - A pureblood vampire who's respected by everyone in the Night-Class, no, better said, he's the leader. When he gives an order, it's final.\nOther vampires fear him and he's loved by alot of girls from the Day-Class. Even through he doesn't really care about them, he does care alot for\nYuki, which you'll notice right away. You'll understand later why a vampire with so much power as Kaname cares so much for a normal girl like Yuki.\n\nI think I told you enough, the point is, the characters WIN!\n\nEnjoyment - \\[10\\]  \nEnjoyment? Do you even need to ask? I REALLY enjoy this. It's a burden to wait for the episodes to air, but we have no other choice but wait, have\nwe? If you like a mysterious story, vampires and some scary moments, watch Vampire Knight. I'll probably recommend this to everyone because this is\nsomething that everyone would like.\n\nOverall - \\[9\\]  \nWhat? Miss ''I enjoy-it-so-much'', you didn't gave it a 10!  \nYes, people, I know what you're thinking. But you guys must remember, that I'd also like to see this from another point of view. Since I have also\nread a part of the manga, I know how it could have been. I really think that the people who made the Vampire Knight-anime did an awesome job! If you\nsee the original when reading the manga, you might understand why I gave this a 9. Don't forget to watch it now, I'll hunt you!\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Story - [10]<br>If you haven't read the manga or saw some episodes of the anime, you'll probably already have an idea what this is about... Vampires. I say that you're right, but if you watch or read Vampire Knight, you'll find out that it's more than only ''vampires''. Let's start with the beginning.</p><p>Vampire Knight revolves between Yuki, Zero and Kaname. Yuki and Zero are Cross-Academy's prefects (guardians). It's their duty to prevent the contact between the Day and the Night-class, even through it's very hard for them because all the girls from the Day-class have a big crush on the guys from the Night-class, that's not very rare because everyone in the Night-class looks gorgeous. Why are prefects needed? To prevent the Day-class of finding out the secret from the Night-class, in reality, all of them are vampires. The ''leader'' of the Night-class is Kaname Kuran, the one who saved Yuki's life when she was little. Ofcourse he's a vampire too and the most powerful of all, a pureblood. Yuki and Zero both live with the chairmain of Cross-Academy, Cross Kaien. Yuki doesn't have any memories from when she was a kid, her memories begin on the day that Kaname saved her from a vampire. Kaname asked the chairman to look after her, and he did. The same goes of Zero, a couple of years later he comes to live with Yuki and the chairmain to, after his parents where killed by a vampire.</p><p>What is so loveable about all this? Both the anime and the manga have a mysterious feeling to it, that you know that something is going on but you don't know what. You'll also notice and the story gets ''darker'' each time, and that the characters change. It takes a while until you really understand everything because they tell you the story bit by bit, you may also expect some big changes, I warn you. I wish that I could tell you more, but I don't want to spoil it for you guys. I really recommend you guys both the manga and the anime.</p><p>Animation - [8]<br>Well, the animation. I must say that it's alot better than I expected. Still, I know that alot of manga-fans might be dissapointed. The manga might have better art, but I think that the anime is really well made.

It was released a year after the original Sister Princess, and was made by the same\nstudio, ZEXCS. It is often purported as a direct continuation of Sister Princess as such, but this is not entirely true for several reasons. For one,\nRePure makes little to no mention to the events of the previous Sister Princess. Secondly, Wataru Minakami is no longer the main character, and many\nside characters from the previous serious either do not appear, or appear only as cameos(that's gotta sting). Finally, where as the previous series\nhad an actual plot, this series is a collection of short vignettes each focusing on a different sister, and more closely following the light novels\nthe entire series was based off. All that being said, while not being a direct sequel, this show would be better watched after viewing the previous\nseries. Why didn't they just make a direct sequel? Who knows?\n\nThose that did not see Sister Princess, or did see but disliked, are better off skipping the show entirely as they will be bored to death. The show\ngives better insight into the twelve sisters; their memories and motives reasons for the immense adoration of their brother being the main focus of\nthe show. The show has barely any comedy, a slow pace, and hardly any sense of conflict or drama. Each episode is split into two halves, the first a\nshort story being the only source of anything in the show, and the second half a tale about one of the sisters. It is, for all intents and purposes,\npure fanservice for fans of the original Sister Princess. If you loved the sisters and their cute quirks, then this show will quench your thirst for\nmore of their antics. Otherwise, the show would serve as a good sleeping aid.\n\nIf you did like the previous Sister Princess and the characters, then you will love this show. Not just for the stories either. The animation is\nmarkedly better than the previous series, the vignette on sleepy younger, French sister Aria being pretty avante' garde and a nice visual treat. The\nsoundtrack too, is a major improvement. The new opening being miles ahead of the previous one, and a personal favorite of mine.\n\nNow, one thing that is also different, is the amount of incestual sub-text. The previous series had a bit of it, especially with sister Sakuya.\nHowever, this show is drenched in it. The incest is less of a \\*wink\\* \\*wink\\* \\*nudge\\* \\*nudge\\*, and more of a major driving force smashing you in\nthe face like a railgun-fired hammer.

With Soushi, her new supernatural neighbors, and the beginning of high school, Ririchiyo definitely seems to have a difficult path ahead of her.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":40,"titles":{"en":"Inu X Boku Secret Service","en_jp":"Inu x Boku SS","en_us":"Inu X Boku Secret Service","ja_jp":"妖狐×僕SS"},"canonicalTitle":"Inu x Boku SS","abbreviatedTitles":["Youko x Boku SS"],"averageRating":"74.47","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"91","3":"1","4":"123","5":"2","6":"151","7":"9","8":"612","9":"6","10":"922","11":"31","12":"2045","13":"87","14":"4020","15":"107","16":"3226","17":"75","18":"1471","19":"35","20":"2575"},"userCount":30838,"favoritesCount":341,"startDate":"2012-01-13","endDate":"2012-03-30","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":322,"ratingRank":2084,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6439/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6439/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6439/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6439/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6439/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6439/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6439/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6439/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6439/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":12,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":288,"youtubeVideoId":"FaN8_sr8akg","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1663/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1663/media"}},"user":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1663/relationships/user","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1663/user"}},"createdAt":"2013-03-19T20:01:03.905Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-19T07:59:14.971Z","content":"*Inu x Boku SS* (Secret Service) tells the story of *Shirakiin Ririchiyo*, a young Atavist girl (which is a youkai descendant) and her adventures in\n\"The Hall of Ayakashi\", a special place designed for some kind of supernatural people to live peacefully among themselves.

Why this series has garnered\nso much popularity over the years is surely no surprise to anyone: ask anybody who watches anime on a regular basis about the bloodiest, most\ndisturbing series and you’ll often get Elfen Lied as the answer. This series is far from a simple no-brainer gorefest, though, and those who dare give\nit a shot (it’s certainly not for those who can’t stomach this type of thing) may find themselves completely overwhelmed by its beautifully unique\nstory and memorable characters. I should know, as I am one of them.\n\nFirst thing’s first: let me give you a little insight on the plot of the series. Elfen Lied primarily focuses on the relationship between humans and\nthe so-called Diclonius (humans with horns attached to their heads and equipped with invisible telekinetic arms). One of our main characters, Lucy, is\na Diclonius girl who escapes from a research facility where those of her kind are held captive and experimented upon in violent ways. Make no mistake,\nthese strange, yet intriguing beings are far from innocent – most of them do not back away from violence and getting on their bad side can often\nresult in a bloodbath. After forcing her way out (and by that I mean violently dismembering and ripping the heads off of everyone that stands in the\nway), Lucy is shot in the very last moment by a sniper. The shot doesn’t entirely hit, but it does damage her head enough to cause a deep amnesia and\nsplit her personality in two parts. Not much time passes and Lucy is found on a nearby beach by Kohta and his cousin Yuka, but Lucy’s second\npersonality, Nyu, has taken over and this results in her acting like a child and unable to remember anything that happened up to that point.\n\nMost of the show focuses on Lucy’s stay with Kohta and Yuka and the hunt by those whom she evaded to recapture her. Calling Elfen Lied the bloodiest\nand goriest anime series ever made is more an opinion rather than a fact, but it is certainly up there. You can tell from the first ten minutes that\nit definitely lives up to its reputation: Lucy’s escape from the research facility is one of the most powerful and downright disturbing scenes I have\never since in any anime series and it contained more blood and violence than I was prepared for – and believe me, I was pretty prepared.\n\nOne of the first things which caught my attention when I started watching the series was its opening song, called Lilium, which is sung in Latin. I\nwas immediately fascinated by its truly wonderful tone and the atmosphere which it evoked. The opening couldn’t have been more fitting, if you ask me.\nIt really captures the essence of what this anime is about.\n\nElfen Lied may sport a brutal attitude and at times it seems as though there is little to stop it from going way over the edge with its graphic\ndepictions of violence and gore, but beyond its hardened exterior lies a soft and sensible core. The relationships between characters are surprisingly\ngenuine and feel really natural. Over the course of its running time we come to care for each and every character in a special way. No one is innocent\nhere, but it’s the imperfections and the little things that each character says or the does that shapes them into perfectly developed characters. I\nwish I could say that Elfen Lied does all these things to perfection, but there are some noticeable flaws among these beautifully executed aspects.\nSome characters react in an odd way to a few things, which sometimes leads to confusion among the audience and incapability to connect with the\nparticular scene when it happens. For example, a young girl discovers a brutally dismembered man on the beach and her reaction suggests that she\nthinks little of it. Such things really lead to confusion and sometimes ruin the moment. I don’t wanna spoil anything, so I’ll just say that Kohta\ngoes through some extremely emotional situations during the last episodes and his reactions are underwhelming, to say the least.\n\nWith only thirteen episodes and one special original video animation, Elfen Lied is a relatively short anime series. The manga it is based on is said\nto continue beyond the series’ ending and offer a lot more backstory and information about some characters, though I have not read it and am therefore\nunable to comment on the matter. I will say this, though: as far as the anime is concerned, it does a great job at developing the characters and\nadvancing the story in a satisfying manner for the audience.\n\nElfen Lied is most definitely not for the faint of heart. There are lots of scenes which depict violence against animals, incest and even sexual\nabuse. Even though the series is filled with controversy and gore, it does manage to deliver a really beautiful and emotional story filled with\ninteresting, well-developed characters. I was a little bit disappointed with the open ending and the final episode overall, but it did little to make\nme forget about the rest of this spectacular anime series. If you feel like you’ve got the stomach for it, be sure to check it out as it will\ndefinitely leave a lasting mark on you. It certainly did so in my case.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>I was fortunate enough to watch one of the most highly regarded and critically praised anime series, called Elfen Lied.

Clannad follows its delinquent protagonist Tomoya\nOkazaki through his senior year of high school and his attempts to help out the various heroines of the story. The anime's storyline comprises mostly\nof his interactions with the main heroine Nagisa Furukawa, who tends to act shy in most situations and suffers from a mysterious illness. As the main\nstory arc progresses it does so slowly and it tends to act as more of a background plot in between a series of small arcs which focus on telling a\nstory about each of the main characters. Characters in Clannad have a fair bit of personality and it is very enjoyable to see how they interact with\none another as the plot progresses, and I more than once found my self either laughing or on the verge of tears depending on the situation. While\nit's hard to find any major faults with Clannad its repeated divergences from the main plot and its abundance of sad moments some of which can be\nover the top or unnecessarily dramatic may be a turn off for some. Kyoto Animations has done an excellent job on the animation of Clannad and by far\nprobably has some of the best visuals in any anime I've ever seen. They put a lot of emphasis on lighting and shadows which makes it quite visually\nappealing to the eyes and makes it easy to immerse yourself into the story. For the soundtrack of Clannad they reused a lot of the sounds and music\nfrom the visual novel that the anime is based off of. The soundtrack fits very well with the overall tone of the anime with only a couple instances\nwhere I felt that the music didn't really fit the scene or could've been used better. Overall Clannad is a very enjoyable anime with plenty of funny\nas well as sad moments that will leave you wanting more in the end.\n\nI also highly recommend the watching of its sequel Clannad:After Story which is a little bit more serious than Clannad but improves on the original in\nalmost every way. \n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Based off of a visual novel made by Key, Clannad is a fantastic adaptation of its source material. Clannad follows its delinquent protagonist Tomoya Okazaki through his senior year of high school and his attempts to help out the various heroines of the story. The anime's storyline comprises mostly of his interactions with the main heroine Nagisa Furukawa, who tends to act shy in most situations and suffers from a mysterious illness. As the main story arc progresses it does so slowly and it tends to act as more of a background plot in between a series of small arcs which focus on telling a story about each of the main characters.

Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai is an anime that tells you a story of a high schooler named Kyousuke Kousaka. His\nrelationship with his sister named Kirino Kousaka is pretty troublesome, and the anime centers around that relationship. I have always liked sister\n&amp; brother stories, and on top of that the anime also involves a lot of otaku culture in it. Kirino is a top achiever in her school, great athlete\nand also a model. And, when no one sees, she also plays eroge games and watches anime. One night, she shows her secret to his brother and asks for a\nlife counselling. The idea itself is pretty unique to me, and from the start this anime seemed to be very funny. The story itself is not bad, but what\nI really liked was the characters, Kirino is a a character that you want to hug tightly, but at the same time you want to beat him to death. It seems\nlike she is your usual tsundere, but I think she is more than that. Kirino's father is an old fashioned man that has no tolerance for things like\neroge. And her mother is your typical kind mother. The only character which I didn't like that much is, surprisingly, the main character. Kyousuke\ncould have had some balls to stand up against his sister. Their relationship works fine this way also, but I would have wanted to see him getting\nreally mad at Kirino some times.\n\nWhen you put this setting into action, you can't have a bad anime. Kyousuke's and Kirino's relationship is one very interesting thing, It's like\nyou are waiting for them to either kill each other or commit something that is also illegal at any point. It doesn't help that Kirino also plays\neroges that have the objective of charming your own little sister, the sibling complex is there all the time, kinda lurking in the shadows when Kirino\nacts all tsundere and I love it. But there's no way that Kirino would ever look her brother that way right, it would be gross! However, in her games\nit's not. At the same time Kyousuke just tries to not give a fuck and just help his sister. When you mix this up with very tight dad that has no\nunderstanding for anything like that, you get very comical and enjoyable anime.\n\nThe otaku culture is also very relevant in this anime. Part of this anime deals with problems that one faces when prejudged based on his hobby. You\nplay eroges, so you are a gross human being. This anime really tries to break that and teach you that any thing that brings you such joy and unifies\npeople like that can't be that bad. At least I saw a meaning like that behind this anime, which is a nice thing. In the end, it's just a hobby, but\nall people don't understand that. That plus Kirino's and Kyousuke's relationship really made this anime worthwhile. I must also mention that is was\nfunny to see her playing those eroges, since I have played some myself and all those things that happen in that anime regarding that are very true.\nAnyone who watches anime can relate himself to this story and feel accepted.\n\nThe ending changes every episode, and there is not even one bad ending there, I liked them all.

However I would not recommended this anime to anyone who does not like\nextreme tragic elements, since that is part of the core of this anime. Based on the rating, this series clearly does not get the attention it really\ndeserves. The plot is dramatic and unique, the art quality was beautiful (especially the use of CGI), and the characters are all dynamic and tragic.\nLet's break it down by categories so I don't get too general.Story: (Refer to this page or Wikipedia for a plot summary) The story is a truly\ncaptivating one that goes beyond the whole \"Humans got infected with some disease and transformed so we're gonna get rid of them.\" Instead it takes\nit to a whole new level, throwing in many philosophical elements about what makes us human as well as having meaning in life. I cannot say anything\nspecifically about the plot itself to avoid spoiling it, but I can say that you cannot be deterred by the first few episodes. The plot becomes more\nand more intense as each episode goes by. In my honest opinion, I found it more captivating than my now 2nd favorite series, Code Geass. 10/10Art:\nFrom what I've read the art seems to be a discrepancy amongst those who have watched this anime. This is mostly due to the fusion of the usual anime\nstyle and CGI. However, the use of CGI makes the fight scenes with Amalgum so much more intense and also gives the Amalgum a feeling of something\ntruly supernatural and different. I haven't seen much CGI in animes I have watched recently, however I must say the art was very well done, fight\nscenes brilliantly choreographed, and there was never a moment where I felt the art was lacking. 10/10Sound: The first and second OP are very catchy\nand fit the mood of the story, that being very intense. Naturally whether you like it or not is an opinion, but overall the sound was very fitting.\nSuch as a soft piano when someone is telling another about a tragic event in their past. I watched it with the English Dub, and I must say I loved it.\nUsually dubs can be iffy depending on the voice cast, but this was certainly not the case. I do wish that they put more music in the fight scenes\nthemselves, to perhaps amplify the feeling. However, that really is my only complaint. 9/10Character: Every character in this anime is tragic. Not in\nthe sense that they are poorly done, but each one of them has or will eventually have something dark that saddens them deeply. As one reviewer already\npointed out (and which I also agree with), the characters act like a real human would. And because of this it is very easy to empathize with almost\nall of the main cast. So in the end, you never really hate a certain character, but realize instead that they are all suffering from something. Any\nmore and I'm afraid I'll spoil something :P. 10/10 hands downEnjoyment: Without a doubt I truly enjoyed this series. Despite its overall tragic\nnature, in the end I didn't feel like it really was a tragedy. Instead I felt a combination of fulfillment, happiness, and hope. Which is definitely\nnot what I expected. Don't be fooled by the rating, this anime has exceeded my (and hopefully your) expectations. 10/10Overall: This anime contains:\nEpic fight scenes, intense plot, well designed characters, tragic elements, and a hopeful ending. Be warned though, I almost cried 3 times during the\nanime, and then 2 times for real near the end.

Be warned though, I almost cried 3 times during the anime, and then 2 times for real near the end. If you read this far... then I hope that means you're already watching it :) </p>","likesCount":1,"progress":null,"rating":20,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1674","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1674"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1674/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1674/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"21","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:34.230Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T07:15:51.023Z","slug":"neon-genesis-evangelion","synopsis":"In the year 2015, the world stands on the brink of destruction.

So like any anime that intends to\nbe a traditional “good vs. bad” show, the human racehas created an organization called NERV and a collection of giant robots, known asEvangelions, to\nfight the oncoming threat. And of course, by some unwrittenrule in anime law,all the pilots for the Evasare not highly trained professionals skilled\nin combat, but rather a group ofinexperienced fourteen-year-old children who mustnow save the planet or end up destroyed in a cataclysmic event known\nas theThird Impact. Ofcourse, unbeknownstto basically fucking everyone, there is a secret society bent on the completion of the humaninstrumentality\nproject in order to bring about a new age of human evolution.Confused yet? Don’t worry,it gets worse.\n\n**THE CHARACTERS**  \n**--SHINJI--**\n\nStartingoff is the case ofShinji Ikari.Shinji is the lead protagonist of the Evangelion series and resident whinylittle bitch. Having lost his mother\nback before he could remember and beingheavily neglected by his father Gendo, the world seems to have taken great pleasure in beating the crap outof\nthis poor little Japanese boy and he has never really had any purpose ormeaning in his life until his father, finally finding a use for him, calls\nhimto NERV Headquarters in Tokyo-3 to pilot a giant robot and fight aliens for thegood of mankind. Normally this sort of development would have a\ncharacter growinto a more heroic and world saving role, but of course this is Evangelion andShinji is our introduction to an entire cast of characters\nthat are all equallyscrewed up in their own special ways. Shinji himself suffers from major psychological issues, including a massive guilt complex\nthat makes him believe that everybad situation he has ever been involved in, regardless of his actual influenceon those situations, is entirely his\nfault. This gives him a self-worth comparable to mostmodern JRPG protagonists, minus the ability to occasionally have a backboneevery once in a while.\nHe also suffers from the hedgehog's dilemma, as he isunable to form meaningful human relationships without getting emotionallydamaged by the very\nrelationships he is attempting to form. This of coursemakes him more of a social introvert thanSatou Tatsuhiro from Welcome to theNHK, and it becomes\na reoccurring theme with Shinji that instead of facing his problems and notblaming himself for everything that goes wrong, he prefers to just run the\nfuckaway. If only he could have actually stopped blaming himself for everything andgrown a backbone, he would have been amuch better character\noverall.But instead,we got what we got.****\n\n**--ASUKA--**  \nNext up is the case of Asuka Langley Soryu, a character who is so incrediblydifferent from our whiny protagonist, while suffering for almost the exact\nsame problems. Incontrast to Shinji’s introverted-ness, Asuka is much more outgoing, even sometimes annoyinglyso, with an attitude of extreme smugness\nand superiority to cover up her similaranxieties. As the pilotto Evangalion Unit 02, she appears in episode 8 showing off her impressivepiloting\nskills and being completely bad-ass at everything Shinji seems to havedifficulties with, a fact that she continually taunts him with. Her\nanxietiesbegin to come to light as the show progresses, as her mental state requires herto receive continual praise from basically everything\notherwise her self-worthbegins to drop down towards Shinji levels. On the whole though, between thethree main Evangelion pilots, Asuka seems to be the\nsanest. Well, as sane as you can getfor being a character in Evangelion anyways. Yes, she has a messed up childhood and really doesn't have the\nbestof experiences during the show itself, but anytime I think back on her character as a whole, I remember just her bad-ass moments of awesome,\nmaking this German vixen one of my favorite female animecharacters.\n\n**--REI--**  \nAnd now the case of Rei Aninami. As a character, Rei is not much to talk about without gettinginto the heavily spoilerific aspects of her character,\nas she, for the majority of the show,remains shrouded in mystery. We know that she is the test pilot for EvangelionUnit 00, has some sort of personal\nconnection to Shinji’s father, Gendo Ikari, thecurrent NERV commander,and also allows people to check off funky coloured hair on your Anime Wildcard\nBingo Sheet. Like seriously though, blue hair and red eyes?And no one thinks this is unusually at all? Huh. More importantly though, Rei is the\niconicemotionless doll character, theirony of this being that Evangelion’s creator Hideaki Anno originally designed Rei to be someonewho existed on\nthe wrong side of the uncanny valley, attempting to be an exampleof just how creepy and inhuman an emotionless-like doll can be. Instead though, she\nended up becomingher own freaking character archetype that has since exploded and is responsiblefor a vast number of attempted clones, all with the\nsame emotionless behaviors  though with some characters getting far betterdeveloped than Reiherself. Maybe Anno shouldn't have dressed her up in a\nsexy skintight plugsuit, I don’t know.\n\n**--MISAITO--**  \nThe last character I’m going to talk about directly is Misato Katsuragi, the operationsdirector in charge of most of the Angel battles, as well as the\nmentor to theEvangelion pilots, regardless of her qualifications as an adult role model. Herpersonality allowsfor changes depending on the situation,\nas she is able to be calm and collectedduring a mission, but also to be more carefree when she’s off the clock. Likeeveryone else in the show,she\nsuffers from her ownpersonal trauma, mostly stemming from being a survivor of the Second Impact, the catastrophicevent that originally introduced the\nAngels to the human race. This gives her psychological symptoms very similarto Shinji and Asuka, though her methods of coping far exceed theirs,\nallowing her to appearfar more upbeat thanmore or less any other character in the show. She is also the resident motherlyfigure for the Eva pilots,\nthough less so for Rei, as Asuka’s parents are dead and Gendo really couldn't give two shitsabout his son. Thisseems to be one of the more admirable\nfactors of her character, as even thoughat times she is as emotionally broken as everyone else on the show, she stillhas the sense to make sure those\nunder her care are safe. Well, as safe as letting them fight the greatestthreat humanity has ever faced, anyways.\n\n**--SUPPORTING CAST--**  \nIf I was to attempt to continue to explain all the other characters, I would be here allday, as the complete range of mental nitwits far exceeds that\nof what is ableto be talked about in a short review such as this. The vast number of character interactions andrelationships in the show deserve far\nmore than just brief mentions, so I’ll let youexperience them yourself when you get to see them. But just know that they are all emotionally broken\ninsome way, shape orform, even if they are only background characters or those with very littlerelevance to the overall plot of the show.\n\n**THE STORY**\n\nTo say that the story ofEvangelion is amazing is like saying that Twilight sucks. The majority of the community know it to be true, though there\nareradical people with an opposite opinion. This is because, unfortunately, Evangelion is also subject to immense hype. Like any anime that hasbeen\nplaced on a pedestal by some to be considered for the award of greatestanime that has ever existed, anime fans going into Evangelion for the firsttime\nmight come out of it saying that it wasn't that great because it did notlive up to the hype created by its fans. If you can get past that though\nandtake it at face value as a show that originally aired in 1995, then you shouldbe fine.\n\nThe main focus of Evangelion has always been on its characters and theirdevelopment. Everycharacter presented in the show has interesting aspects that\nthe viewer wouldlike to be explored, and the show obliges them, though usually in a fashion that raises morequestions about the characters than it\nanswers. Although,in addition to that,Evangelion also follows a standard mech anime with a “monster of the week” type setup. A new Angel appearsand\nthe characters comeup with a new way to defeat the threat that culminates in a quick battle scenebefore the Angelexplodes, usually in a symbolic\ncross-like fashion, before the episode ends and we do it all overagain next week. But as the show progresses, the usual tropes from mech anime start\nto deteriorate,usually in correlation with the mental health of the main characters. Plot elements getintroduced that quickly make the show change\nfrom a show like Mobile SuitGundam into a more darker representation of the genre in the same vein as Madoka Magica and, to a lesser extent, Digimon\nTamers, all ofwhich being examples of shows that heavily deconstruct the genre to which theybelong. This is further proved when the show places less\nfocus on the battlescenes between the Evasand the Angels –though they are great spectacles – and more on the real meat of the show, focusing squarely\non the characters.\n\n**THE ENDING**\n\nNormally I don’t like mentioning a show’s ending to a large enough degree that it warrants its own section of the review,but my philosophy is that the\nending of any show is paramount and what Ibelieve stopped Evangelion from being truly great was its ending. It’s fairlywell known that during the\nlatter half of the show’s production, money startedto run short. I could argue that the production staff knew about this eventualshortage from early\non,otherwise we would have not had the immensely riveting scenes like one particularly boring scene in episode 4. But theflaws in production value\nslowly start to manifest as the show continues, withincreasing amounts of fan service and nudity being used in an attempt to keepviewers distracted\nfrom the flaws that were becoming larger and larger thecloser the show got to the end. The final two episodes is where all animation quality gets\nthrown out thewindow due to lack of budget and the show ends on a less than ceremonious conclusionthat, well, kind ofirked a lot of people.\n\nSure, a lot of people have taken theending and said that it was intentional and adds on to the show’s already existing religious symbolism, attempting\nto explain the complete nonsenseand mindfuckery that those episodes had to offer. But I take such thoughts witha grain of salt, as the lack of funds\nis a much more understandableexplanation. Besides, Hideaki Anno must have thought that the ending was bad, otherwise he would nothave had to remake\nit…TWICE.\n\n**THE ANIMATION**\n\nThis is definitely anarea in which Evangelion tended to fall harder than most. I already mentionedthe financial problems that affectedthe animation\nquality as the show neared to a close, though honestly when it wasn't a battle scene between the Evas and the Angels, Gainax skimped\nbasicallyeverywhere they could. One common production shortcut that a lot of shows liketo take is restricting character movement so that only a\ncharacter’s mouth is animated. Evangelion goes a stepfurther by having many scenes where the character who is speaking has theirmouth either covered,\nor off camera, so as to further skimp by not even having to animate themouths moving. The entire production from start to finish is a perfect\nexampleof what you get by doing the bare minimum the majority of the time. The only exception tothis is the aforementioned fight scenes, and in those\ncases, well it’s clear tosay where the majority of the budget for this show went, as those scenes in particular far exceedthe rest of the show in\nterms of quality.\n\n**THE SOUND**\n\nIn terms of theoverall soundtrack,Evangelion is nothing extraordinary, minus a few tracks that stand out for interesting reasons. One of\nmy favorite songs from theentire soundtrack of the original series is a song called “Decisive Battle”. It’s usually played inthe buildup to a fight\nand even during the fight depending on how long thebattle lasts. Fun fact though is that this song puts Evangelion up alongsideFull Metal Panic and\nBig O for having a song that was heavily influenced by analready existing composition. As the song Decisive Battle from Evangelion borrows a theme\nfrom James Bond for its main battle music, but hey, imitation is thesincerest form of flattery.\n\nThe dub for Evangelion can bea little harder for people to handle than most; while overall I personally applaud theentire cast for their performances,\nI do admit that the actors do take theirtime settling into their roles, and there are moments early on in the show thatare wince-worthy inhow some\nlines are delivered.\n\nThe only other notablething as far as sound goes is the opening theme , and Evangelion’s OP gets a lot of love,appearing at the top of a lot of\npeople’s lists for the greatest anime openingin existence. WhileI will admit it has its merits, I would never put it up that high myself. Sure, it’s a\ncatchy song andall, but you know what else was catchy? The Black Plague. Just because it’s catchy doesn't mean it’s good. Also, if you ever have\nthetime, go ahead and look up the translated lyrics to the opening, then keep inmind that the entire song is about Shinji. It’ll make you laugh, well,\nmaybe.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\nConsidering how oldthe show is getting nowadays, it might be harder todescribe it as a modern classic, but its influence and popularity is\nfairlyunmatched. There isn't much more to say that hasn't been said, while avoiding spoilersin some form or another. I could have written a section\non the religioussymbolism that takesplace within the show, but let’s be honest. If you’re not overly religious yourself, then the majority of this\nsymbolism will goright over your head and have no effect in your enjoyment of this show as a whole. I willhowever give a recommendation to skip the\nfinal two episodes of the show in favor of insteadwatching the original film End of Evangelion. Of course, you are free to watch the original ending\nif youwish and you probably should watch it at some point just so you can understandwhat all the fuss is about when people mention it in conversation.\nThe story continues in the film, though theending still lacks the answers you might be looking for. Also, when you do get around to buying the show –\nwhich, if you are a self-respecting anime buyer, you should –for the love of Haruhi, don’t buy thecollectors tin, because this thing is a piece of\nshit. You can’t even get your fingers inside topull out the DVDs.So just buy the thin pack or something, anyways.\n\n With all that in mind, I have meticulously calculated values for the categories of Story, Characters, Animation, Sound,and my own personal enjoyment,\nand after having its DNA analysis confirmed blue and having Holden (From HoldenReviews on Youtube) declare “IT’S ANANGEL”, has meawarding Neon Genesis\nEvangelion with a score of 8.06 out of 10 and rating the showCertified Frosty, a rating reserved only for the best of the best and the show’s too\nimportant toignore. At the time of this video, the show has previously been licensed by ADVFilms, but is currently available from Section 23 Films\nsince ADV nipped off tothe back and died. Itis also available from Madmen Entertainment,if you happen to live in Australia. For everyone else,\nyou’reshit outta luck as it’s not even available for legal streaming at current,besides possibly Netflix or something, though hopefully someone will\nget onthat at some point. As far as alternate anime recommendations, I’ll be quick tomention the possible Evangelion clone RahXephon. Though if you’re\nwanting something a bit more upbeat, then I would highlyrecommend Gurren Lagann,as it’s a fantastic anime also done by Gainax. And lastly, since I\nknow it’s going to be brought upin the comments, I will get around to talking about the Rebuild of Evangelionmovies whenever they all get released in\nEnglish, but until then and probablyeven after, I’llstill recommend watching this original series first, as it lays a lot of the groundwork andstory\nthat just gets cut out of the films due to a lack in running time. Sowith that, I leaveyou. Until nexttime, ladies, gentlemen, and others, stay\nfrosty.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>You can either A) Watch the review in Video form embedded below, or B) read the transcript of the review. <b>THE CHOICE IS YOURS!</b></p><p><b>THE SETTING</b></p><p>Set in a pre-apocalyptic alternateuniverse, the world of Evangelion is under a constant threat from “Angels”,mysterious Lovecraftian-like beings that appear,basically out of nowhere, with the intention of, as far as we know, destroying the entirety of thehuman race.

But just know that they are all emotionally broken insome way, shape orform, even if they are only background characters or those with very littlerelevance to the overall plot of the show. </p><p><b>THE STORY</b></p><p>To say that the story ofEvangelion is amazing is like saying that Twilight sucks. The majority of the community know it to be true, though there areradical people with an opposite opinion. This is because, unfortunately, Evangelion is also subject to immense hype. Like any anime that hasbeen placed on a pedestal by some to be considered for the award of greatestanime that has ever existed, anime fans going into Evangelion for the firsttime might come out of it saying that it wasn't that great because it did notlive up to the hype created by its fans. If you can get past that though andtake it at face value as a show that originally aired in 1995, then you shouldbe fine. </p><p>The main focus of Evangelion has always been on its characters and theirdevelopment. Everycharacter presented in the show has interesting aspects that the viewer wouldlike to be explored, and the show obliges them, though usually in a fashion that raises morequestions about the characters than it answers. Although,in addition to that,Evangelion also follows a standard mech anime with a “monster of the week” type setup. A new Angel appearsand the characters comeup with a new way to defeat the threat that culminates in a quick battle scenebefore the Angelexplodes, usually in a symbolic cross-like fashion, before the episode ends and we do it all overagain next week. But as the show progresses, the usual tropes from mech anime start to deteriorate,usually in correlation with the mental health of the main characters. Plot elements getintroduced that quickly make the show change from a show like Mobile SuitGundam into a more darker representation of the genre in the same vein as Madoka Magica and, to a lesser extent, Digimon Tamers, all ofwhich being examples of shows that heavily deconstruct the genre to which theybelong. This is further proved when the show places less focus on the battlescenes between the Evasand the Angels –though they are great spectacles – and more on the real meat of the show, focusing squarely on the characters.</p><p><b>THE ENDING</b></p><p>Normally I don’t like mentioning a show’s ending to a large enough degree that it warrants its own section of the review,but my philosophy is that the ending of any show is paramount and what Ibelieve stopped Evangelion from being truly great was its ending. It’s fairlywell known that during the latter half of the show’s production, money startedto run short. I could argue that the production staff knew about this eventualshortage from early on,otherwise we would have not had the immensely riveting scenes like one particularly boring scene in episode 4. But theflaws in production value slowly start to manifest as the show continues, withincreasing amounts of fan service and nudity being used in an attempt to keepviewers distracted from the flaws that were becoming larger and larger thecloser the show got to the end. The final two episodes is where all animation quality gets thrown out thewindow due to lack of budget and the show ends on a less than ceremonious conclusionthat, well, kind ofirked a lot of people.</p><p>Sure, a lot of people have taken theending and said that it was intentional and adds on to the show’s already existing religious symbolism, attempting to explain the complete nonsenseand mindfuckery that those episodes had to offer. But I take such thoughts witha grain of salt, as the lack of funds is a much more understandableexplanation. Besides, Hideaki Anno must have thought that the ending was bad, otherwise he would nothave had to remake it…TWICE.</p><p><b>THE ANIMATION</b></p><p>This is definitely anarea in which Evangelion tended to fall harder than most. I already mentionedthe financial problems that affectedthe animation quality as the show neared to a close, though honestly when it wasn't a battle scene between the Evas and the Angels, Gainax skimped basicallyeverywhere they could. One common production shortcut that a lot of shows liketo take is restricting character movement so that only a character’s mouth is animated. Evangelion goes a stepfurther by having many scenes where the character who is speaking has theirmouth either covered, or off camera, so as to further skimp by not even having to animate themouths moving. The entire production from start to finish is a perfect exampleof what you get by doing the bare minimum the majority of the time. The only exception tothis is the aforementioned fight scenes, and in those cases, well it’s clear tosay where the majority of the budget for this show went, as those scenes in particular far exceedthe rest of the show in terms of quality. </p><p><b>THE SOUND</b></p><p>In terms of theoverall soundtrack,Evangelion is nothing extraordinary, minus a few tracks that stand out for interesting reasons. One of my favorite songs from theentire soundtrack of the original series is a song called “Decisive Battle”. It’s usually played inthe buildup to a fight and even during the fight depending on how long thebattle lasts. Fun fact though is that this song puts Evangelion up alongsideFull Metal Panic and Big O for having a song that was heavily influenced by analready existing composition. As the song Decisive Battle from Evangelion borrows a theme from James Bond for its main battle music, but hey, imitation is thesincerest form of flattery.</p><p>The dub for Evangelion can bea little harder for people to handle than most; while overall I personally applaud theentire cast for their performances, I do admit that the actors do take theirtime settling into their roles, and there are moments early on in the show thatare wince-worthy inhow some lines are delivered.</p><p>The only other notablething as far as sound goes is the opening theme , and Evangelion’s OP gets a lot of love,appearing at the top of a lot of people’s lists for the greatest anime openingin existence. WhileI will admit it has its merits, I would never put it up that high myself. Sure, it’s a catchy song andall, but you know what else was catchy? The Black Plague. Just because it’s catchy doesn't mean it’s good. Also, if you ever have thetime, go ahead and look up the translated lyrics to the opening, then keep inmind that the entire song is about Shinji. It’ll make you laugh, well, maybe.</p><p><b>FINAL VERDICT</b></p><p>Considering how oldthe show is getting nowadays, it might be harder todescribe it as a modern classic, but its influence and popularity is fairlyunmatched. There isn't much more to say that hasn't been said, while avoiding spoilersin some form or another. I could have written a section on the religioussymbolism that takesplace within the show, but let’s be honest. If you’re not overly religious yourself, then the majority of this symbolism will goright over your head and have no effect in your enjoyment of this show as a whole. I willhowever give a recommendation to skip the final two episodes of the show in favor of insteadwatching the original film End of Evangelion. Of course, you are free to watch the original ending if youwish and you probably should watch it at some point just so you can understandwhat all the fuss is about when people mention it in conversation. The story continues in the film, though theending still lacks the answers you might be looking for. Also, when you do get around to buying the show – which, if you are a self-respecting anime buyer, you should –for the love of Haruhi, don’t buy thecollectors tin, because this thing is a piece of shit. You can’t even get your fingers inside topull out the DVDs.So just buy the thin pack or something, anyways.</p><p> With all that in mind, I have meticulously calculated values for the categories of Story, Characters, Animation, Sound,and my own personal enjoyment, and after having its DNA analysis confirmed blue and having Holden (From HoldenReviews on Youtube) declare “IT’S ANANGEL”, has meawarding Neon Genesis Evangelion with a score of 8.06 out of 10 and rating the showCertified Frosty, a rating reserved only for the best of the best and the show’s too important toignore. At the time of this video, the show has previously been licensed by ADVFilms, but is currently available from Section 23 Films since ADV nipped off tothe back and died. Itis also available from Madmen Entertainment,if you happen to live in Australia. For everyone else, you’reshit outta luck as it’s not even available for legal streaming at current,besides possibly Netflix or something, though hopefully someone will get onthat at some point. As far as alternate anime recommendations, I’ll be quick tomention the possible Evangelion clone RahXephon. Though if you’re wanting something a bit more upbeat, then I would highlyrecommend Gurren Lagann,as it’s a fantastic anime also done by Gainax. And lastly, since I know it’s going to be brought upin the comments, I will get around to talking about the Rebuild of Evangelionmovies whenever they all get released in English, but until then and probablyeven after, I’llstill recommend watching this original series first, as it lays a lot of the groundwork andstory that just gets cut out of the films due to a lack in running time. Sowith that, I leaveyou. Until nexttime, ladies, gentlemen, and others, stay frosty.</p>","likesCount":67,"progress":null,"rating":16,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1675","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1675"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1675/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1675/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"6589","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6589"},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:42:11.993Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"sword-art-online","synopsis":"In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched.

The first camp is compressed of all the people who love the\nshowunconditionally flaws and all, and will defend the show like nothing else inexistence matters. And the Second camp, is full of people who see\nnothing butthe shows flaws, and cannot understand the blind acceptance of camp #1 so muchthat they ridicule anyone who does not agree with them that\nthe show inquestion is indeed complete shit. These are the types of shows that get usuallylabeled as either controversial, over-rated, or shonen; they\nare also shows that loose many fans simplybecause of how extreme the fan base becomes and that to even consider that theshow is less than perfect\nmakes you and idiot who doesn't know better. It’s like politics, you’re not allowed to siton the fence, you have pick a side. You’re either with me\nor with them! Whichmakes my position on Sword Art Online rather difficult; because you see I couldfinish an episode of this show, sit back and think,\nman that was a goodepisode! I really enjoyed myself. Of course then I have this little voice inthe back of my head, decked out in my reviewer outfit\ngoing: Hahahahahah! Ohwait, you’re serious? Let me laugh even harder, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\n**Setting**\n\nIn the year 2022, a genre of video games exist called Virtual Reality MassivelyMultiplayer Online Role Playing Games. One such game in this genre is\nthe newlyreleased Sword Art Online, that coupled with a virtually reality helmet allowsplayers to control their in game avatars with their minds as if\nthey areactually there living in that virtual world.\n\nOf course everything is fun and games until the mysterious creator of SAOremoves the player’s ability to log out, trapping them in this world until\ntheycomplete his challenge. They must band together and defeat the 100 floors of thegame before they are allowed to leave, and it becomes much more of\na game whenthey are informed that in SAO, if you die, you die for real, now do-overs, norespawns. LET THE GAME BEGIN!\n\nAstute viewers may recognize the premise’s similarity with that of the.Hack//Franchise not only because both of them take place in a virtual MMO,\nbutbecause they both involve players being trapped inside the game unable toescape. But the differences between the two are simple one involves\npeoplestanding in a circle talking, and the other involves a life or death survivalgame that is F\\*\\*KING AWESOME. Try and guess which iswhich.\n\nOneof the reasons why I believe SAO to be as popular as it is, is because of howwell it knows its audience. Whether you like it or not, on both sides\nof theocean a very large portion of the Otaku viewer base, are also avid gamers, andit is unlikely that they have never at one time, played an MMO\nbefore, theentire MMO genre being well known for its repetitively addictive nature.It doesn't matter what MMO you have played either, weather it be\nWoW, Guild Wars,Final Fantasy XII, or hell freaking Runescape, but to create a story thatcapitalises largely on the popularity of MMO’s was a\nbrilliant idea in manycases, as it plays to the want and desires of those viewers who generally woulddo anything they could to be involved and play\nthis game that the charactersare in, heck I bet some of them would even want to be trapped there as well toavoid the harshness of a thing called REAL\nLIFE. And it’s because of all ofthis that many people are willing to completely ignore the flaws that the showpresents them just so that they can keep\nwith their fantasy. SPEAKING OF FLAWS!\n\n**Characters  \n--Kirito--**\n\nBy far one of the more disappointing factors of this entire show is it’s characterization  and development or lack thereof, of the show’s\nmajorcharacters.\n\nFirst off is our male protagonist Kirito, a male gamer from japan who began toplay video games to escape his family and the real world. Kirito, is a\npowergamer, obsessed with being a strong character though also is a lone wolf andeven though plays games that are designed to be played as a group\ngoes solo.He’s also a whiny little b\\*\\*ch with Takfumi syndrome.\n\nA lot of people have brought up the topic of how Kirito is a prime example of a“Wish fulfillment  character, and while I would rather have found a\ndifferentterm to make myself sound more original, it’s hard because that’s exactly whathe is. Everything has a habit of going his way, he overpowers\nbasicallyeveryone he encounters, whether he should or not, he’s a higher level than mostplayers regardless of the fact that he adventures solo and not\nwith a party, afeat of which any MMO player will tell you does not happen, he is able to completesuperhuman feats not even possible by the system\nbecause f\\*\\*k it he’s Kirito,and over the course of the series develops his own harem, complete witheverything from token loli’s, cat girls, and his\ncousin. No seriously.\n\nAnd that’s another thing, I’m not one to say that Girls don’t exist on theinternet, because they do and I know quite a few of them, but it would be\nsafeto say that the female population of Sword Art Online would be a rather smallminority wouldn't it? Episode 01 also shows this when all the female\ncharactersthat were shown turned out to be male characters when the big bad plot-device makeseveryone look exactly like how they are in the real\nworld. And yet, all of thesewomen look super-hot, making me question why they were playing online games tobegin with, but also why more often then not\nthey end up falling for ouranti-social hero Kritio for no god damn reason.\n\n**--Asuna--**\n\nNextup is the supposed lead female character Asuna. I say supposed because besidesbeing heavily featured in the show’s opening as well as being one of\nthe mainstory divers for the entire second half, she is one of the most neglectedcharacter in terms of development and stereotyping that I have seen\nin a longtime. She starts off well enough, being introduced in episode 2 as a new characterwho, even though does not know the game very well, plays\nexceptionally and ismore or less a complete badass. Unfortunately, by her next appearance inepisode 5 after the plot goes and gets sidelined with\nfiller, she getstransformed from lead female badass to token tsundere love interest, withmoments few and far between to show otherwise, before\nbecoming princess peachfor the entire latter half of the show if you know what I mean.\n\nIt’s the characterization towards her that just pisses me off, in an industrywhere strong female protagonists are few and far between, you have\nthischaracter that starts off with amazing potential to become something like ayoung Motoko Kusanagi sure she’s only 16 years old and can’t be exactly\nlikethe major but something in the direction was completely possible, instead Ifeel like they pulled a Metroid Other M and just completely\ndisrespected hercharacter by making her reliant on a man to save her. Like why do people alwaysconfine main characters of these shows into the same\narchetype? “BECAUSE IT’S AFUCKING ANIME THAT’S WHY, THE CHARACTERS ARE ALWAYS WHINY LITTLE SHIT CHILDREN.”\n\n**--SUPPORTING CAST--**\n\nThesecondary characters all have very little screen time on their own, usuallyonly focused on for one episode and then forgotten to make way for\nthemassively important character that is Kirito, the only other character to getmuch screen time is that of Leafa, a player who helps Kirito in his\njourney inthe second half of the show since Asuna was unavailable, and as much as I likeLeafa, she gets sidelined just as much as Asuna did with her\nmajor definingfactor being her fans vice avatar her love of Kirito despite the fact that shedoesn’t have a chance with him. And of course other things\n\\*cough\\* Spoilers\\*Cough\\*\n\n**STORY**\n\nTheStory of SAO is in fact the most tragic thing about the whole show. It takes aspecial something to have a premise with as much potential as this one, only torailroad everything and employ time jumps wherever possible. The first half ofthe show is by far the most guilty of this, consenceing 2 whole years of timeinto the first 12 episodes, with several months of un-used time just filling upthe in-between space between episodes, all the while the viewer is presentedwith what could be classified as filler episodes, Sure there is an overarchingstory, but it’s downplayed more or less the entire show: We have to fight toget to the 100<sup>th</sup> floor! But first we are going to help this tokenloli, and then get a sword made with the help of this chick, oh and then we aregoing to go fishing because EVERYONE LOVES FISHING IN VIDEO GAMES.There are moments of clarity though when the story really grabs you. The mostinteresting aspect of the show early on is that of the Death Penalty, you\ndieand that’s it. It could have been played as an excuse to make the story lesslike a game and more like an actual fictional fantasy universe with\nlife or deathconsequences but it became so much more than that. They spend time making surethat you feel the weight of death in this world and just\nhow emotional losingpeople for good can be, and it’s not something that is usually focused on.\n\nThe mid-point of the show also decides to throw a wrench in everything bycompletely changing the overall plot of the show to something\ncompletelydifferent, almost as if the entire first half was just a prologue to what wouldfollow, with the second half being less fillery and much\nclearer in terms ofplot. Well as clear as SAO can get anyways. I can’t really explain much aboutthe second half of the show without venturing heavily\ninto spoiler territory unfortunately.\n\n**ANIMATION**\n\nThe animation for Sword Ass Online from A-1 Pictures is stunning, and it’s oneof the merits of the show that not many can argue against. In the past\nA-1pictures have been knows for shows like Black Butler, Anohana, and Sound of theSky, and while the production values for those shows tended to be\nhigher thanmost, they never had the same amount of action that SAO does, and the fightscenes are where the animation truly shines, showing the vast\nexpanses of theonline world for all to see. As well as Fan-service because why the hell not!?!\n\n**SOUNDTRACK**\n\nFor those of you unaware, I am a Yuki Kajiura fanboy, and have taken to watchingshows specifically because she was the one to provide the soundtrack\nfor it. Sowhile I would like to give her full points here for just existing I can’t,mainly because as good as this soundtrack is, and it is very good,\nthere is nospecific song in the music that stands out to me, nothing that I would like tohear on its own without visual accompaniment, which is rare,\nMadoka Magica hada myriad of choir tracks that stood out, Tsubasa had Song of Storm of Fire,Guarden of Sinners had the fantastic M12+13, and Kajiura’s\nwork on the .HackFranchise had more good singles then I can mention, so it was reallydisappointing that there were no stand out tracks this time\naround, don’t getme wrong, the sound track is still amazing, and when the boss battles start andthe orchestra kicks in it’s a treat indeed, but I\nguess I’m just used to acertain flare that I just never got from SAO. Depressing, but you can’t win allthe time I suppose.  \n6 by Lisa, originally I didn't think much of this opening song it seemed rathergeneric when I first heard it bot over time it grew on me, plus the\nsong is availableon iTunes for a dollar, so go buy it.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\nSword Art Online is a prime example of misused potential, it hooks you earlyon with a strong opening, before meandering in filler, getting off-track\nwith athinly veiled overall story arc, and not developing its major characters aswell as it could have. And that’s just before the half way point, the\nsecondstory arc continues the depressing downwards spiral, with numerous unexplainedplot-devices, a pointless romance subplot, and a final villain\nthat was morelaughable then menacing, not to mention that what I considered to be the mostimportant question asked in the entire show was never\nanswered. Why did thecreator of SAO video game trap all of those players? Was it just a game? Did hehave a god complex? Or was it more personal or\ndeeply psychological issue? Wemay never know, unless you read the original light novels most likely. On theplus side, though the show may have\nplummeted from an attempted rise up themountain of Anime Greatness the ride down was to some degree, highly enjoyable,if for no other reason than to\njust watch the continual supply of fail, verypretty fail I might add, with a soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura and everything plus,I honestly believe that\nthe early episodes handled the death aspect of thesetting very well and it was a real shame that they dropped the impact of thetopic so quickly.\nThough for the most part the ending of the whole show wassomewhat satisfying, which is more than I can say for other shows and hey theending is\nparamount, and it could have ended in a much worse way then it did somajor props there.\n\nWith all that in mind, I have meticulasly calculated values for thecategories of Story, Characters, Animation, Sound, and my own personalenjoyment,\nafter which tossing it into a cage, having it escape and almost beraped by tentacles before throwing it right back into the cage has me awardingSword\nArt Online with a 7.5 out of 10, and a recommendation…to Stream it ratherthan buy, it’s worth the watch certainly but only buy if you know you\nalreadylike it. At the time of this video SAO is available for streaming over onCrunchyroll, and though at this exact moment does not have a DVD\nrelease, hasbeen licensed by Aniplex and most likely a DVD release is forthcoming, expensiveas their releases tend to be, and the show should also be\ndistributed by Madmenat some point for those people in Australlia, if you live in Europe though yourshit outta lick for the time being, smoke em if\nyou got em or something. As faras alternate anime recommendations, one would think .Hack//Sign would be a goodchoice, but considering that show is\nboring as sin I will instead point youtowards, Accel world, as it’s by the same original author, and Fate / Zerobecause I haven’t had a chance to\nproperly recommend this show yet and thisseems like a good time because it was fucking awesome, so go watch it. And with that I leave you, until next\ntimeladies, gentlemen and others, stay frosty.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>You can either A) Watch the review in Video form embedded below, or B) read the transcript of the review. <b>THE CHOICE IS YOURS!</b></p><p>Everycouple of years there comes along a show that forces people into one of twocamps.

Try and guess which iswhich.</p><p>Oneof the reasons why I believe SAO to be as popular as it is, is because of howwell it knows its audience. Whether you like it or not, on both sides of theocean a very large portion of the Otaku viewer base, are also avid gamers, andit is unlikely that they have never at one time, played an MMO before, theentire MMO genre being well known for its repetitively addictive nature.It doesn't matter what MMO you have played either, weather it be WoW, Guild Wars,Final Fantasy XII, or hell freaking Runescape, but to create a story thatcapitalises largely on the popularity of MMO’s was a brilliant idea in manycases, as it plays to the want and desires of those viewers who generally woulddo anything they could to be involved and play this game that the charactersare in, heck I bet some of them would even want to be trapped there as well toavoid the harshness of a thing called REAL LIFE. And it’s because of all ofthis that many people are willing to completely ignore the flaws that the showpresents them just so that they can keep with their fantasy. SPEAKING OF FLAWS!</p><p><b>Characters<br>--Kirito--</b></p><p>By far one of the more disappointing factors of this entire show is it’s characterization  and development or lack thereof, of the show’s majorcharacters.</p><p>First off is our male protagonist Kirito, a male gamer from japan who began toplay video games to escape his family and the real world. Kirito, is a powergamer, obsessed with being a strong character though also is a lone wolf andeven though plays games that are designed to be played as a group goes solo.He’s also a whiny little b**ch with Takfumi syndrome.</p><p>A lot of people have brought up the topic of how Kirito is a prime example of a“Wish fulfillment  character, and while I would rather have found a differentterm to make myself sound more original, it’s hard because that’s exactly whathe is. Everything has a habit of going his way, he overpowers basicallyeveryone he encounters, whether he should or not, he’s a higher level than mostplayers regardless of the fact that he adventures solo and not with a party, afeat of which any MMO player will tell you does not happen, he is able to completesuperhuman feats not even possible by the system because f**k it he’s Kirito,and over the course of the series develops his own harem, complete witheverything from token loli’s, cat girls, and his cousin. No seriously.</p><p>And that’s another thing, I’m not one to say that Girls don’t exist on theinternet, because they do and I know quite a few of them, but it would be safeto say that the female population of Sword Art Online would be a rather smallminority wouldn't it? Episode 01 also shows this when all the female charactersthat were shown turned out to be male characters when the big bad plot-device makeseveryone look exactly like how they are in the real world. And yet, all of thesewomen look super-hot, making me question why they were playing online games tobegin with, but also why more often then not they end up falling for ouranti-social hero Kritio for no god damn reason.</p><p><b>--Asuna--</b></p><p>Nextup is the supposed lead female character Asuna. I say supposed because besidesbeing heavily featured in the show’s opening as well as being one of the mainstory divers for the entire second half, she is one of the most neglectedcharacter in terms of development and stereotyping that I have seen in a longtime. She starts off well enough, being introduced in episode 2 as a new characterwho, even though does not know the game very well, plays exceptionally and ismore or less a complete badass. Unfortunately, by her next appearance inepisode 5 after the plot goes and gets sidelined with filler, she getstransformed from lead female badass to token tsundere love interest, withmoments few and far between to show otherwise, before becoming princess peachfor the entire latter half of the show if you know what I mean.</p><p>It’s the characterization towards her that just pisses me off, in an industrywhere strong female protagonists are few and far between, you have thischaracter that starts off with amazing potential to become something like ayoung Motoko Kusanagi sure she’s only 16 years old and can’t be exactly likethe major but something in the direction was completely possible, instead Ifeel like they pulled a Metroid Other M and just completely disrespected hercharacter by making her reliant on a man to save her. Like why do people alwaysconfine main characters of these shows into the same archetype? “BECAUSE IT’S AFUCKING ANIME THAT’S WHY, THE CHARACTERS ARE ALWAYS WHINY LITTLE SHIT CHILDREN.”</p><p><b>--SUPPORTING CAST--</b></p><p>Thesecondary characters all have very little screen time on their own, usuallyonly focused on for one episode and then forgotten to make way for themassively important character that is Kirito, the only other character to getmuch screen time is that of Leafa, a player who helps Kirito in his journey inthe second half of the show since Asuna was unavailable, and as much as I likeLeafa, she gets sidelined just as much as Asuna did with her major definingfactor being her fans vice avatar her love of Kirito despite the fact that shedoesn’t have a chance with him. And of course other things *cough* Spoilers*Cough*</p><p><b>STORY</b></p>TheStory of SAO is in fact the most tragic thing about the whole show. It takes aspecial something to have a premise with as much potential as this one, only torailroad everything and employ time jumps wherever possible. The first half ofthe show is by far the most guilty of this, consenceing 2 whole years of timeinto the first 12 episodes, with several months of un-used time just filling upthe in-between space between episodes, all the while the viewer is presentedwith what could be classified as filler episodes, Sure there is an overarchingstory, but it’s downplayed more or less the entire show: We have to fight toget to the 100<sup>th</sup> floor! But first we are going to help this tokenloli, and then get a sword made with the help of this chick, oh and then we aregoing to go fishing because EVERYONE LOVES FISHING IN VIDEO GAMES.<p>There are moments of clarity though when the story really grabs you. The mostinteresting aspect of the show early on is that of the Death Penalty, you dieand that’s it. It could have been played as an excuse to make the story lesslike a game and more like an actual fictional fantasy universe with life or deathconsequences but it became so much more than that. They spend time making surethat you feel the weight of death in this world and just how emotional losingpeople for good can be, and it’s not something that is usually focused on.</p><p>The mid-point of the show also decides to throw a wrench in everything bycompletely changing the overall plot of the show to something completelydifferent, almost as if the entire first half was just a prologue to what wouldfollow, with the second half being less fillery and much clearer in terms ofplot. Well as clear as SAO can get anyways. I can’t really explain much aboutthe second half of the show without venturing heavily into spoiler territory unfortunately.</p><p><b>ANIMATION</b></p><p>The animation for Sword Ass Online from A-1 Pictures is stunning, and it’s oneof the merits of the show that not many can argue against. In the past A-1pictures have been knows for shows like Black Butler, Anohana, and Sound of theSky, and while the production values for those shows tended to be higher thanmost, they never had the same amount of action that SAO does, and the fightscenes are where the animation truly shines, showing the vast expanses of theonline world for all to see. As well as Fan-service because why the hell not!?!</p><p><b>SOUNDTRACK</b></p><p>For those of you unaware, I am a Yuki Kajiura fanboy, and have taken to watchingshows specifically because she was the one to provide the soundtrack for it. Sowhile I would like to give her full points here for just existing I can’t,mainly because as good as this soundtrack is, and it is very good, there is nospecific song in the music that stands out to me, nothing that I would like tohear on its own without visual accompaniment, which is rare, Madoka Magica hada myriad of choir tracks that stood out, Tsubasa had Song of Storm of Fire,Guarden of Sinners had the fantastic M12+13, and Kajiura’s work on the .HackFranchise had more good singles then I can mention, so it was reallydisappointing that there were no stand out tracks this time around, don’t getme wrong, the sound track is still amazing, and when the boss battles start andthe orchestra kicks in it’s a treat indeed, but I guess I’m just used to acertain flare that I just never got from SAO. Depressing, but you can’t win allthe time I suppose.<br>6 by Lisa, originally I didn't think much of this opening song it seemed rathergeneric when I first heard it bot over time it grew on me, plus the song is availableon iTunes for a dollar, so go buy it. </p><p><b>FINAL VERDICT</b></p><p>Sword Art Online is a prime example of misused potential, it hooks you earlyon with a strong opening, before meandering in filler, getting off-track with athinly veiled overall story arc, and not developing its major characters aswell as it could have. And that’s just before the half way point, the secondstory arc continues the depressing downwards spiral, with numerous unexplainedplot-devices, a pointless romance subplot, and a final villain that was morelaughable then menacing, not to mention that what I considered to be the mostimportant question asked in the entire show was never answered. Why did thecreator of SAO video game trap all of those players? Was it just a game? Did hehave a god complex? Or was it more personal or deeply psychological issue? Wemay never know, unless you read the original light novels most likely. On theplus side, though the show may have plummeted from an attempted rise up themountain of Anime Greatness the ride down was to some degree, highly enjoyable,if for no other reason than to just watch the continual supply of fail, verypretty fail I might add, with a soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura and everything plus,I honestly believe that the early episodes handled the death aspect of thesetting very well and it was a real shame that they dropped the impact of thetopic so quickly. Though for the most part the ending of the whole show wassomewhat satisfying, which is more than I can say for other shows and hey theending is paramount, and it could have ended in a much worse way then it did somajor props there.</p><p>With all that in mind, I have meticulasly calculated values for thecategories of Story, Characters, Animation, Sound, and my own personalenjoyment, after which tossing it into a cage, having it escape and almost beraped by tentacles before throwing it right back into the cage has me awardingSword Art Online with a 7.5 out of 10, and a recommendation…to Stream it ratherthan buy, it’s worth the watch certainly but only buy if you know you alreadylike it. At the time of this video SAO is available for streaming over onCrunchyroll, and though at this exact moment does not have a DVD release, hasbeen licensed by Aniplex and most likely a DVD release is forthcoming, expensiveas their releases tend to be, and the show should also be distributed by Madmenat some point for those people in Australlia, if you live in Europe though yourshit outta lick for the time being, smoke em if you got em or something. As faras alternate anime recommendations, one would think .Hack//Sign would be a goodchoice, but considering that show is boring as sin I will instead point youtowards, Accel world, as it’s by the same original author, and Fate / Zerobecause I haven’t had a chance to properly recommend this show yet and thisseems like a good time because it was fucking awesome, so go watch it. And with that I leave you, until next timeladies, gentlemen and others, stay frosty.</p>","likesCount":81,"progress":null,"rating":14,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1676","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1676"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1676/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1676/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"242","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/242/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:04:01.495Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"gungrave","synopsis":"Brandon Heat and Harry MacDowel, two friends so close they could be called brothers, receive an abrupt and violent reminder one fateful day of how appallingly merciless the world around them can be.

Did we make the wrong decision after all? I can't seem to remember when things started to take a turn for the worse. In the end it\nturned out like this. Still...\"*\n\nFor reasons she doesn't understand, young Mika Asagi is being hunted down by the terrifying mafia syndicate known as Millenion, and they've sent\ntheir greatest weapons after her, their mindless modified soldiers known as Orgmen. There is only one man who can protect her, and after giving his\nlife for her mother and father he comes back from beyond the grave to do it all over again. Beyond the Grave is the name he adopts, but in life he was\nknown as Brandon Heat, and the man known as Bloody Harry, the merciless boss of Millenion Harry MacDowel, was his best friend. They joined Millenion\ntogether, climbed the ladder and supported each other as they tried to reach the top. Then, something happened that turned them against one another,\nand now as Grave he must confront Harry once again. Did Harry betray Brandon, or did Brandon betray Harry? In the mafia, nothing is as simple as it\nappears.\n\nBoy, this sure was made by the creator of Trigun. That was one of the first observations I made while watching this anime, and it held true to the\nend. Many creators have some recurring styles and motifs shared between their works, and comparing it to such a well-known and well-loved classic has\nthe capacity to be both good and bad. It certainly doesn't help that this was also adapted from a video game; game adaptations in general rarely fare\nwell, and from what I've heard the original game itself was mediocre at best (I haven't played it though, so take that with a grain of salt). With\nsuch a strange, potentially disastrous production history I honestly didn't know what to expect going into this series. It's still very much its own\nthing, but its creative background is definitely notable enough to warrant mention. Don't make a drinking game out of the times I say \"Trigun\" or\n\"video game\" in this review, because it will kill you. Just wanted to get that out there.\n\nMadhouse of the early 2000s wasn't as consistently solid a studio as they are now, and Gungrave is definitely a little rough around the edges.\nNightow's character designs definitely give the show a distinct flavor, leaning more toward realism than Trigun but still retaining a tendency toward\nsome weird proportions, with scraggly limbs, long faces and broad shoulders. Grave's design in particular looks like the unholy lovechild of Legato\nBluesummers and Brilliant Dynamites Neon. It's a rough, harsh-looking series, nary a bishonen to be seen, and I think that's what they were going\nfor. The style takes a little getting used to, and when the budget drops it can be hard to keep those designs appealing, but when the animation hits\nits stride it looks great. Of particular note is its use of [lighting](#) and lens distortions, which add a lot to some already incredibly tense\nmoments. Like Black Lagoon, another famous gunfighting Madhouse series, the action scenes occasionally amount to the characters standing in one place\nshooting without worrying about getting shot, but thankfully this gets phased out in time for the climactic battles later on. The animation isn't\ngreat, but it's good. Let's leave it at that.\n\nThis series boasts a strong soundtrack that's largely comprised of vaguely Italian-sounding string and orchestra pieces with a little synth mixed in,\ngenerally sticking to the mafia motif while ranging in tone from warm and familial to cold and dangerous. There's some really good music here, but\nweirdly enough I think Gungrave is at its best when there's no music at all. This series thrives on quiet character moments, and some of its best\nscenes go by in complete silence. There are some exceptions, but on a whole the music for this series is at its best when it's either gentle and\nunderstated, diegetic (from a source that the characters themselves can hear, like a radio) or just not there at all. The soundtrack is still great,\nthough, so you should definitely give it a listen if you ever get the chance.\n\nThe cast of this series is 99% populated by gruff old men, which means the Los Angeles pool of voice actors is perfect for the job. All the big boys\nare here: William Frederick Knight, Michael McConnohie, Beau Billingslea, the list keeps going. The Japanese dub was very good as well, but there's\none actor in the dub who steals the show completely, and that is Tony Oliver as Harry. His Japanese seiyuu, Kenji Yamada, plays him as fairly\nlaid-back, in control but unassuming. Tony Oliver, on the other hand, seems to understand the character much better, his voice always carries a twinge\nof aggression. Harry is a very ambitious character, someone who's always taking the initiative to get ahead, and Oliver captures that ambition with\nevery word he speaks. Kirk Thornton, Steve Blum and a several others play their roles well, and Tom Wyner does a fantastic job as an older version of\nHarry in the second half of the show. As usual there are some awkward secondary characters here and there, but on a whole it's a laudable dub well\nworth listening to for Harry alone, though not quite good enough that I'd recommend it to dub haters.\n\nWhile Trigun was well-known for its creative worldbuilding and grand concepts, the thing that really set it apart from the crowd was its strong\nbeating heart, and the same can be said of Gungrave. Yes, there is technology that can revive the dead and create super-soldiers, not to mention a\nvery well fleshed-out look at mafia operations and the underworld, but the thing that really holds this story together through it all is the concept\nof loyalty, and what it really means to betray someone. Millenion is held together by a cardinal rule known as the Code of Iron, which declares that\nall traitors to the organization, regardless of status or standing, receive an equal penalty: death. Such a code is simple in theory but exceedingly\ncomplex in practice, and the first half of the series, which follows Brandon and Harry's rise to power, takes full advantage of that ambiguity.\nMillenion's leader, Big Daddy, carries a lot of understandable guilt and self-doubt after dirtying his hands the way only a mafia boss could over the\nyears, and the Code of Iron that forms the crux of his loyalty to those below him is how he comes to terms with it. The various members of Millenion,\nas well as several third-party characters, all have their own concept of loyalty, but it never becomes trite or stale the way shonen friendship\nspeeches do.\n\nThat's not to say that the show is dour and political all the time, though, it's also very cool. The characters here all have ridiculous,\nover-the-top, completely badass names: Brandon Heat, Harry MacDowel, Balladbird Lee, Bear Walken, Cannon Vulcan, Laguna Glock, Blood War (no,\nseriously) and as yet another Trigun comparison there's even a character named Descartes. The mafia exploits are intriguing, the ways they make money\nand how they're integrated into the community is intricate and closely resembles how a real-life mafia would operate. Aside from the choreography\nhiccup I mentioned earlier, the battles are intense, imaginative in the different weapons and styles used but still very grounded and often telling us\nsomething meaningful about the characters involved without breaking suspension of disbelief... at least in the first half. Even when it gets really\ntalky, Gungrave is never boring. This is a rare balance that keeps the show engaging if you don't want to think about it too hard, but there's still\na lot of depth and subtlety to the characters here for those who want something more from their choice of entertainment.\n\n[][1]The characterization, though, is definitely the meat of the story, and at the heart of it all are Brandon and Harry. Harry is ambitious to the\npoint of ruthlessness, but his goals aren't without principles. His philosophy is that those with power are free not only to take what they want, but\nalso to give it away, and while he's hardly a paragon of selflessness there's a lot more to his vision than pure egotism. He has a grand plan and\nbelieves what he's doing is for the best, which makes him extremely corruptible. Brandon is a much purer individual by contrast, and his goals are\nmuch simpler. He's quiet and unassuming (think \"video game protagonist\") but earnest and genuine. He just wants to live a happy life with his\nfriends and loved ones, and if that means helping Harry climb the ladder then he'll become a mafia sweeper without hesitation, but he's also there\nto step in if his best friend strays too far off course. But of course, it's never that simple. As Brandon comes to love and respect Millenion's\nleader, Big Daddy, alongside his continuing relationship with his childhood friend Maria, it becomes clear that staying loyal to one might mean\nbetraying another, and he has to come to terms with this in his own way. Several other side characters bring their own perspectives, but for the sake\nof brevity I'll not delve too far into them. Suffice it to say that the first half of Gungrave is one of the greatest betrayal stories in all of\nanime, right up there with Guts and Griffith. Now if only the story had a stronger sense of focus.\n\n  \nOnce again following in the footsteps of Trigun, about halfway through Gungrave shifts its tone and focus dramatically and doesn't quite manage to tie up its loose ends. In the first half, a process known as necrolization is introduced that brings back the dead as super-soldiers. Okay, I could go with that, it's both necessary for Brandon to come back as Grave and a good way to fuel Harry's ambitions. In the second half, a new process is introduced that can transform living soldiers into mindless drones called Orgmen, as well as transforming their leaders into sentient monsters known as Superiors, and this is where it gets pretty ridiculous. Aside from a little added perspective to an already-peripheral \"have I overstepped the boundaries laid down by god?\" subplot, these elements serve next to no purpose and could easily have been written out completely with relative ease. Instead, it turns the show from grounded character drama to over-the-top action spectacle, and the show's video game roots start to rear their head. The Orgmen are video game mooks, and the Superiors are video game bosses, period. These fights are just there to be cool and action-packed, but that was never what Gungrave was really about.Nightow is a creative man to a fault. He has a lot of grand, wonderful ideas but doesn't always know what to do with them. Maybe with more runtime or\ntighter writing it could have given meaning to the cacophony, but the world of Gungrave is a cluttered mess. Even in its stronger first half, the\nseeds of its oncoming problems were present--allusions to an unspecified war, Tomases from Trigun racing in the place of horses and some really\noutlandish technology make it clear just how little we know about the world of Gungrave, and it stays that way to the very end with disparate elements\nthat really don't feel like they all belong in the same story. None of that, however, was as obnoxious as the inclusion of the Superiors, which took\nwhat could have been some of the most emotionally involving confrontations and made them... well, not bad, but they mostly didn't have nearly the\nimpact they should have. It's hit-and-miss. In the last few episodes a rival faction comes pretty much out of nowhere just to make the ending fall\ninto place.

Did we make the wrong decision after all? I can't seem to remember when things started to take a turn for the worse. In the end it turned out like this. Still...\"</i></p><p><br>For reasons she doesn't understand, young Mika Asagi is being hunted down by the terrifying mafia syndicate known as Millenion, and they've sent their greatest weapons after her, their mindless modified soldiers known as Orgmen. There is only one man who can protect her, and after giving his life for her mother and father he comes back from beyond the grave to do it all over again. Beyond the Grave is the name he adopts, but in life he was known as Brandon Heat, and the man known as Bloody Harry, the merciless boss of Millenion Harry MacDowel, was his best friend. They joined Millenion together, climbed the ladder and supported each other as they tried to reach the top. Then, something happened that turned them against one another, and now as Grave he must confront Harry once again. Did Harry betray Brandon, or did Brandon betray Harry? In the mafia, nothing is as simple as it appears.</p><p>Boy, this sure was made by the creator of Trigun. That was one of the first observations I made while watching this anime, and it held true to the end. Many creators have some recurring styles and motifs shared between their works, and comparing it to such a well-known and well-loved classic has the capacity to be both good and bad. It certainly doesn't help that this was also adapted from a video game; game adaptations in general rarely fare well, and from what I've heard the original game itself was mediocre at best (I haven't played it though, so take that with a grain of salt). With such a strange, potentially disastrous production history I honestly didn't know what to expect going into this series. It's still very much its own thing, but its creative background is definitely notable enough to warrant mention. Don't make a drinking game out of the times I say \"Trigun\" or \"video game\" in this review, because it will kill you. Just wanted to get that out there.</p><p>Madhouse of the early 2000s wasn't as consistently solid a studio as they are now, and Gungrave is definitely a little rough around the edges. Nightow's character designs definitely give the show a distinct flavor, leaning more toward realism than Trigun but still retaining a tendency toward some weird proportions, with scraggly limbs, long faces and broad shoulders. Grave's design in particular looks like the unholy lovechild of Legato Bluesummers and Brilliant Dynamites Neon. It's a rough, harsh-looking series, nary a bishonen to be seen, and I think that's what they were going for. The style takes a little getting used to, and when the budget drops it can be hard to keep those designs appealing, but when the animation hits its stride it looks great. Of particular note is its use of <a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow\">lighting</a> and lens distortions, which add a lot to some already incredibly tense moments. Like Black Lagoon, another famous gunfighting Madhouse series, the action scenes occasionally amount to the characters standing in one place shooting without worrying about getting shot, but thankfully this gets phased out in time for the climactic battles later on. The animation isn't great, but it's good. Let's leave it at that.</p><p>This series boasts a strong soundtrack that's largely comprised of vaguely Italian-sounding string and orchestra pieces with a little synth mixed in, generally sticking to the mafia motif while ranging in tone from warm and familial to cold and dangerous. There's some really good music here, but weirdly enough I think Gungrave is at its best when there's no music at all. This series thrives on quiet character moments, and some of its best scenes go by in complete silence. There are some exceptions, but on a whole the music for this series is at its best when it's either gentle and understated, diegetic (from a source that the characters themselves can hear, like a radio) or just not there at all. The soundtrack is still great, though, so you should definitely give it a listen if you ever get the chance.</p><p>The cast of this series is 99% populated by gruff old men, which means the Los Angeles pool of voice actors is perfect for the job. All the big boys are here: William Frederick Knight, Michael McConnohie, Beau Billingslea, the list keeps going. The Japanese dub was very good as well, but there's one actor in the dub who steals the show completely, and that is Tony Oliver as Harry. His Japanese seiyuu, Kenji Yamada, plays him as fairly laid-back, in control but unassuming. Tony Oliver, on the other hand, seems to understand the character much better, his voice always carries a twinge of aggression. Harry is a very ambitious character, someone who's always taking the initiative to get ahead, and Oliver captures that ambition with every word he speaks. Kirk Thornton, Steve Blum and a several others play their roles well, and Tom Wyner does a fantastic job as an older version of Harry in the second half of the show. As usual there are some awkward secondary characters here and there, but on a whole it's a laudable dub well worth listening to for Harry alone, though not quite good enough that I'd recommend it to dub haters.</p><p>While Trigun was well-known for its creative worldbuilding and grand concepts, the thing that really set it apart from the crowd was its strong beating heart, and the same can be said of Gungrave. Yes, there is technology that can revive the dead and create super-soldiers, not to mention a very well fleshed-out look at mafia operations and the underworld, but the thing that really holds this story together through it all is the concept of loyalty, and what it really means to betray someone. Millenion is held together by a cardinal rule known as the Code of Iron, which declares that all traitors to the organization, regardless of status or standing, receive an equal penalty: death. Such a code is simple in theory but exceedingly complex in practice, and the first half of the series, which follows Brandon and Harry's rise to power, takes full advantage of that ambiguity. Millenion's leader, Big Daddy, carries a lot of understandable guilt and self-doubt after dirtying his hands the way only a mafia boss could over the years, and the Code of Iron that forms the crux of his loyalty to those below him is how he comes to terms with it. The various members of Millenion, as well as several third-party characters, all have their own concept of loyalty, but it never becomes trite or stale the way shonen friendship speeches do.</p><p>That's not to say that the show is dour and political all the time, though, it's also very cool. The characters here all have ridiculous, over-the-top, completely badass names: Brandon Heat, Harry MacDowel, Balladbird Lee, Bear Walken, Cannon Vulcan, Laguna Glock, Blood War (no, seriously) and as yet another Trigun comparison there's even a character named Descartes. The mafia exploits are intriguing, the ways they make money and how they're integrated into the community is intricate and closely resembles how a real-life mafia would operate. Aside from the choreography hiccup I mentioned earlier, the battles are intense, imaginative in the different weapons and styles used but still very grounded and often telling us something meaningful about the characters involved without breaking suspension of disbelief... at least in the first half. Even when it gets really talky, Gungrave is never boring. This is a rare balance that keeps the show engaging if you don't want to think about it too hard, but there's still a lot of depth and subtlety to the characters here for those who want something more from their choice of entertainment.</p><p><a href=\"http://i1163.photobucket.com/albums/q558/MadShadow42/StarcrossedLovers_zpse97c66bf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>The characterization, though, is definitely the meat of the story, and at the heart of it all are Brandon and Harry. Harry is ambitious to the point of ruthlessness, but his goals aren't without principles. His philosophy is that those with power are free not only to take what they want, but also to give it away, and while he's hardly a paragon of selflessness there's a lot more to his vision than pure egotism. He has a grand plan and believes what he's doing is for the best, which makes him extremely corruptible. Brandon is a much purer individual by contrast, and his goals are much simpler. He's quiet and unassuming (think \"video game protagonist\") but earnest and genuine. He just wants to live a happy life with his friends and loved ones, and if that means helping Harry climb the ladder then he'll become a mafia sweeper without hesitation, but he's also there to step in if his best friend strays too far off course. But of course, it's never that simple. As Brandon comes to love and respect Millenion's leader, Big Daddy, alongside his continuing relationship with his childhood friend Maria, it becomes clear that staying loyal to one might mean betraying another, and he has to come to terms with this in his own way. Several other side characters bring their own perspectives, but for the sake of brevity I'll not delve too far into them. Suffice it to say that the first half of Gungrave is one of the greatest betrayal stories in all of anime, right up there with Guts and Griffith. Now if only the story had a stronger sense of focus.</p><br>Once again following in the footsteps of Trigun, about halfway through Gungrave shifts its tone and focus dramatically and doesn't quite manage to tie up its loose ends. In the first half, a process known as necrolization is introduced that brings back the dead as super-soldiers. Okay, I could go with that, it's both necessary for Brandon to come back as Grave and a good way to fuel Harry's ambitions. In the second half, a new process is introduced that can transform living soldiers into mindless drones called Orgmen, as well as transforming their leaders into sentient monsters known as Superiors, and this is where it gets pretty ridiculous. Aside from a little added perspective to an already-peripheral \"have I overstepped the boundaries laid down by god?\" subplot, these elements serve next to no purpose and could easily have been written out completely with relative ease. Instead, it turns the show from grounded character drama to over-the-top action spectacle, and the show's video game roots start to rear their head. The Orgmen are video game mooks, and the Superiors are video game bosses, period. These fights are just there to be cool and action-packed, but that was never what Gungrave was really about.<p>Nightow is a creative man to a fault. He has a lot of grand, wonderful ideas but doesn't always know what to do with them. Maybe with more runtime or tighter writing it could have given meaning to the cacophony, but the world of Gungrave is a cluttered mess. Even in its stronger first half, the seeds of its oncoming problems were present--allusions to an unspecified war, Tomases from Trigun racing in the place of horses and some really outlandish technology make it clear just how little we know about the world of Gungrave, and it stays that way to the very end with disparate elements that really don't feel like they all belong in the same story. None of that, however, was as obnoxious as the inclusion of the Superiors, which took what could have been some of the most emotionally involving confrontations and made them... well, not bad, but they mostly didn't have nearly the impact they should have. It's hit-and-miss. In the last few episodes a rival faction comes pretty much out of nowhere just to make the ending fall into place. Thankfully, that very ending turns out to be the show's saving grace. It brings the story of Brandon and Harry full-circle in a way that's cathartic, completely justified and entirely satisfying.</p><p>I'm not sure whether I can truly call Gungrave \"great\" or not, but there's certainly a lot of greatness in it. The plot goes some weird and unnecessary places, and like Harry himself it becomes something of a victim of its own ambition, but the parts that shine through are truly fantastic.

It is not something to be toyed with.\"*\n\nFirst, let me get the obvious out of the way: the first two words I heard about this series were \"torture porn\" and it's not far from the truth. I\ndo think there's more to the show than that, it tries to have an engaging plot beyond pure smut and the concept is actually a decent one that\nsomewhat justifies the show's perverse tendencies. Setting aside any moral issues I might have with it, for the purposes of this review it's no\ndifferent than any other kind of fanservice, especially since it's sort of justified by the show's mythos. That said, if frequent nudity, erotic\nmoaning and women being torn asunder in various and sundry ways is a deal-breaker for you, there's no need to read this review any further because\nRin: Daughter of Mnemosyne has quite a lot of that going on. You have been warned.\n\nThe visuals behind Mnemosyne are hit and miss. On one hand, the backgrounds are nice and detailed and the animation is pretty solid and consistent,\nbut on the other the use of lighting varies wildly in quality and the character designs are a bit generic, sometimes even dipping into ugly. When\nit's too dark, scenes that should be gripping just come out drab, and when it's too bright they end up looking gaudy. The show occasionally strikes\nthe right balance, but the lack of consistency can be distracting, and the choreography behind the fights are pretty lackluster to boot. It's not\ncompletely incompetent, there are some good moments, but most of the show's important action scenes tend to fall flat. Maybe I'm being too harsh,\nit's perfectly watchable and never looks bad, it just could've used more panache. At the very least, it has a few decent camera angles mixed in.\n\nMaybe it'd be more compelling with better music, but it was not meant to be. Half the time the music doesn't really support the series, it just\nfeels like it was slapped on at the end with barely any thought given. It's a perfectly good soundtrack that could have matched the tone the series\nwas going for in theory, but there was clearly very little effort put into its integration, so the strained music direction is a real shame. Combined\nwith the poorly executed visuals, it makes all the difference between these scenes being edge-of-your-seat thrilling and just \"stuff that happens\".\nI will say that the opening and ending are both hilariously bad Engrish songs.\n\nThe voice acting in both languages is fine, perfectly serviceable all-around, but neither really tries to go beyond the call of duty. The exception to\nthis is Todd Haberkorn as the villainous Apos, his voice dripping with venomous obsession in a way few voice actors can nail. Stop casting him as\nharem leads, Funimation, he's capable of much better than that. Also, I suppose Mimi sounds better in the dub, but that might just be my distaste for\nmoe bleeding through, I'll take Jamie Marchi's sassy performances over Rie Kugimiya's distilled cutesiness any day. I digress. For a show as dry\nand dramatic as this I can't help but think that more nuanced performances would have been fitting, but the scripts and acting in both languages are\npretty content to just skate by. On the surface, the whole package just looks dull and uninspired.\n\nIn case my lack of enthusiasm wasn't immediately apparent, I'll just come out and say it: I was not impressed by this series in the least. Looking\nat the concept on paper I can see where its modest popularity comes from, promising a sexy thriller with suspenseful battles, engaging mysteries and a\nunique mythos. Oh, and lots of fanservice, if that tickles your fancy. In execution, though, the series doesn't deliver. Out of all the possible\nreactions I was prepared for going into this series, the one thing I did not expect was that I would find it boring, and yet that is just what\nhappened. The poor direction is undeniably a big part of it--for a show that seems to want to stand out, the fights and action sequences are pretty\nstandard, no flair or finesse to keep the audience's interest. Even when the risk takes on a global scale the tension is nonexistent. Mnemosyne is at\nits best when it's being tongue-in-cheek, so why couldn't it just stick with that?\n\nStill, even with bland execution some shows can leave a positive impression if they put out a decent story. But nope, to call the story here would be\nmediocre would be generous. The entire first three episodes could be removed from the story altogether with only minimal rewriting and at virtually no\ndetriment to the overarching story. The plot drags its feet through arc after inconsequential arc that often have little to do with the ridiculous\nmess that's eventually revealed to be the plot, and at the end of the day it seems to sincerely want the audience to take it seriously on some level.\nI couldn't help but think that this should have been a feature-length film if anything, maybe that would have given it some much-needed focus. We\ndon't need to be repeatedly reminded that vodka means water in Russian repeatedly without variation, thank you very much. Apos' final plan is absurd\nand pointless and half of his means have nothing to do with the end. Several twists are thrown in for no apparent reason except to make the plot more\n\"edgy\", and it gets really old really fast, especially when the dry direction gives every indication that this story really thinks it's actually\ngoing somewhere.\n\nMoreso than its poor plotting, this series falls flat in how it develops--and doesn't develop--its characters. For a centuries-old mystery woman, Rin\nis simpler and more transparent than she has any right to be. She's not unlikable, she has a respect for humanity and cares about the people who are\nclose for her, but aside from getting angry every now and again she wears her heart on her sleeve, she has no hidden depths aside from a bit of\nbackstory in the finale that doesn't really add anything to her character. Her partner Mimi actually gets more development, and that's not saying\nmuch. The side companions they pick up over the course of the series receive much the same treatment. Kouki, for instance, has an interesting\nbackstory that the show conveniently tosses aside for most of his screentime only to pull it back to try to milk it for some last-minute drama. To\nmake matters worse, they're not all that fun to watch. I know this is subjective, but if the show isn't going to make its characters complex and\nthoughtful the least it could do is make them energized. This show waffles incessantly between silly and serious, never sticking to one long enough to\nleave any kind of impression.\n\nI've nearly beaten this show to non-death, but I have to come back to the show's fanservice elements, because while I don't think the raunchy\nmaterial is inherently bad, in execution it drops the show from bland and forgettable to just plain bad. I mentioned that the mythos somewhat\njustified the presence of fanservice in the show, and it does: the Angels are basically incubi, and while I won't spoil it, a certain pairing becomes\npart of a ritual that plays a key role in the series' conclusion. It's ridiculous, but with better execution I'd be willing to go with it. Rin\nusing her sex appeal to get close to her targets on missions? That actually makes sense. Battles fought in minimal if any clothing? A bit much, but it\nhappens. A security guard shoving Rin, the unknown and probably dangerous intruder, to the ground and trying to rape her on the spot without subduing\nher properly? This is getting stupid. Everyone in this show, be they human, Immortal or Angel, is ridiculous loose and horny, to the point that it\noften gets in the way of their common sense. This show's oversexed nature extends well beyond what's justified by the tone and the mythos, it gets\nin the way of the story, and it becomes familiar so quickly that it ends up becoming just dull.\n\nI've seen plenty of series stand out positively for the amount of love and care that went into making them, but despite its unusual production\nhistory and somewhat interesting ideas Mnemosyne feels shockingly cold and apathetic. It baffles me that the makers of something so novel and daring\ncould care so little for their baby, but that appears to be the case. It has no idea what kind of show it wants to be, the end result tries too hard\nto be edgy and not hard enough to be entertainingly over-the-top about it. It still has some funny moments and some cool moments, but they're not\nenough to be called a saving grace. The show had no right to turn out as bland as it did.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"It may sound ironic coming from me, but the gift of life is a fleeting precious thing.

At the very least, it has a few decent camera angles mixed in.</p><p>Maybe it'd be more compelling with better music, but it was not meant to be. Half the time the music doesn't really support the series, it just feels like it was slapped on at the end with barely any thought given. It's a perfectly good soundtrack that could have matched the tone the series was going for in theory, but there was clearly very little effort put into its integration, so the strained music direction is a real shame. Combined with the poorly executed visuals, it makes all the difference between these scenes being edge-of-your-seat thrilling and just \"stuff that happens\". I will say that the opening and ending are both hilariously bad Engrish songs.</p><p>The voice acting in both languages is fine, perfectly serviceable all-around, but neither really tries to go beyond the call of duty. The exception to this is Todd Haberkorn as the villainous Apos, his voice dripping with venomous obsession in a way few voice actors can nail. Stop casting him as harem leads, Funimation, he's capable of much better than that. Also, I suppose Mimi sounds better in the dub, but that might just be my distaste for moe bleeding through, I'll take Jamie Marchi's sassy performances over Rie Kugimiya's distilled cutesiness any day. I digress. For a show as dry and dramatic as this I can't help but think that more nuanced performances would have been fitting, but the scripts and acting in both languages are pretty content to just skate by. On the surface, the whole package just looks dull and uninspired.</p><p>In case my lack of enthusiasm wasn't immediately apparent, I'll just come out and say it: I was not impressed by this series in the least. Looking at the concept on paper I can see where its modest popularity comes from, promising a sexy thriller with suspenseful battles, engaging mysteries and a unique mythos. Oh, and lots of fanservice, if that tickles your fancy. In execution, though, the series doesn't deliver. Out of all the possible reactions I was prepared for going into this series, the one thing I did not expect was that I would find it boring, and yet that is just what happened. The poor direction is undeniably a big part of it--for a show that seems to want to stand out, the fights and action sequences are pretty standard, no flair or finesse to keep the audience's interest. Even when the risk takes on a global scale the tension is nonexistent. Mnemosyne is at its best when it's being tongue-in-cheek, so why couldn't it just stick with that?</p><p>Still, even with bland execution some shows can leave a positive impression if they put out a decent story. But nope, to call the story here would be mediocre would be generous. The entire first three episodes could be removed from the story altogether with only minimal rewriting and at virtually no detriment to the overarching story. The plot drags its feet through arc after inconsequential arc that often have little to do with the ridiculous mess that's eventually revealed to be the plot, and at the end of the day it seems to sincerely want the audience to take it seriously on some level. I couldn't help but think that this should have been a feature-length film if anything, maybe that would have given it some much-needed focus. We don't need to be repeatedly reminded that vodka means water in Russian repeatedly without variation, thank you very much. Apos' final plan is absurd and pointless and half of his means have nothing to do with the end. Several twists are thrown in for no apparent reason except to make the plot more \"edgy\", and it gets really old really fast, especially when the dry direction gives every indication that this story really thinks it's actually going somewhere.</p><p>Moreso than its poor plotting, this series falls flat in how it develops--and doesn't develop--its characters. For a centuries-old mystery woman, Rin is simpler and more transparent than she has any right to be. She's not unlikable, she has a respect for humanity and cares about the people who are close for her, but aside from getting angry every now and again she wears her heart on her sleeve, she has no hidden depths aside from a bit of backstory in the finale that doesn't really add anything to her character. Her partner Mimi actually gets more development, and that's not saying much. The side companions they pick up over the course of the series receive much the same treatment. Kouki, for instance, has an interesting backstory that the show conveniently tosses aside for most of his screentime only to pull it back to try to milk it for some last-minute drama. To make matters worse, they're not all that fun to watch. I know this is subjective, but if the show isn't going to make its characters complex and thoughtful the least it could do is make them energized. This show waffles incessantly between silly and serious, never sticking to one long enough to leave any kind of impression.</p><p>I've nearly beaten this show to non-death, but I have to come back to the show's fanservice elements, because while I don't think the raunchy material is inherently bad, in execution it drops the show from bland and forgettable to just plain bad. I mentioned that the mythos somewhat justified the presence of fanservice in the show, and it does: the Angels are basically incubi, and while I won't spoil it, a certain pairing becomes part of a ritual that plays a key role in the series' conclusion. It's ridiculous, but with better execution I'd be willing to go with it. Rin using her sex appeal to get close to her targets on missions? That actually makes sense. Battles fought in minimal if any clothing? A bit much, but it happens. A security guard shoving Rin, the unknown and probably dangerous intruder, to the ground and trying to rape her on the spot without subduing her properly? This is getting stupid. Everyone in this show, be they human, Immortal or Angel, is ridiculous loose and horny, to the point that it often gets in the way of their common sense. This show's oversexed nature extends well beyond what's justified by the tone and the mythos, it gets in the way of the story, and it becomes familiar so quickly that it ends up becoming just dull.</p><p>I've seen plenty of series stand out positively for the amount of love and care that went into making them, but despite its unusual production history and somewhat interesting ideas Mnemosyne feels shockingly cold and apathetic. It baffles me that the makers of something so novel and daring could care so little for their baby, but that appears to be the case. It has no idea what kind of show it wants to be, the end result tries too hard to be edgy and not hard enough to be entertainingly over-the-top about it. It still has some funny moments and some cool moments, but they're not enough to be called a saving grace. The show had no right to turn out as bland as it did.</p>","likesCount":6,"progress":null,"rating":8,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1678","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1678"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1678/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1678/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"6060","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6060/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:33:44.425Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:23:13.440Z","slug":"bunny-drop","synopsis":"Daikichi Kawachi is a 30-year-old bachelor working a respectable job but otherwise wandering aimlessly through life.

Wanna come home with me?\"*\n\nSlice of life is generally a tricky genre to get right. When I say slice of life, I don't mean those dime-a-dozen high school comedies the industry\nhas become oversaturated with as of late. Rather, I refer to series that find something meaningful to explore through the small conflicts of\ncommonplace events. All too often, attempts at this genre come off as either excessive and unnatural or dull and listless. It stands to reason, then,\nthat the best shows of this kind are the ones that introduce unfamiliar elements that make these characters' lives distinct from our own, while still\nstaying in touch with the little aspects of ordinary life that make people who they are. Bunny Drop is one such work, and it executes this\nbeautifully. It's a small, unambitious story about ordinary people but it carries itself with a certain measure of refined dignity that's rarely\nseen in anime in general, let alone the slice of life genre. It has genuine insight into parenthood, but it never talks down to its audience and you\ndon't have to be a parent to get behind the story. This is quite honestly one of the most accessible anime I've ever seen.\n\nThe staff of Production IG handled this show with the sort of nurturing care rarely seen in a slice of life anime, which usually tend to get the short\nend of the stick production-wise. Backgrounds are surprisingly detailed, colors are warm and rich, and even when the character models go into\nsuper-deformed mode (which happens often) movements are fluid and quality control remains excellent. Of particular note are the opening segments of\neach episode, which are animated in a soft crayon-esque style reminiscent of a children's storybook. That's to say nothing of the charming character\ndesigns. Every character is distinctive in an understated way that isn't too far-removed from reality. Family members really do resemble one another\n(which is especially great since this is a show about family), but not to the point that they could be called carbon copies. The children are cute\nwithout defaulting to an overly moe-fied style as Japanese animation is wont to do. This is a spectacular visual effort that sets the tone for the\nshow perfectly.\n\nThe music is mostly comprised of low-key string pieces, and can best be described as charming for its gentle, sincere simplicity. It can get a bit\nrepetitive, a good portion of the soundtrack is comprised of several different instrumentations of the same basic piece, but perhaps due to the\nseries' short length it never wears out its welcome. I've seen longer anime get away with worse, so really I have no complaints.\n\nThere's one thing about anime voice acting in Japan that makes it perfectly suited to this kind of show, and that's their willingness to fill their\nchild roles with real children. It does happen in the States occasionally (Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist comes to mind\nimmediately) but it's not nearly as common. Rin, her friend Kouki, her cousin Reina and several minor child characters are all played by\nage-appropriate voice actors, which makes them sound genuine as only real children can. Ayu Matsuura in particular does a great job as Rin, and I\nwouldn't be surprised to hear more from her in the years to come as she grows and matures into new roles. The adults sound pretty good too, at least\nto my ears. The lack of a dub does create a problem for some potential viewers, though, which is unfortunate because otherwise I'm fairly confident I\ncan recommend this series to just about anyone.\n\nBunny Drop is first and foremost an emotional series. It's a pretty consistently upbeat series but it never goes too far into \"flowery sunshine and\nrainbows\" territory. This show works because of how true it is to the small, understated moments that a parent and child really do share every day.\nThese moments never feel unnecessary because Daikichi is as new to Rin and to parenting as we are (unless, y'know, you're already a parent), so we\nget to discover these things as he does. Both Daikichi and Rin have time to develop in small, believable ways and build a realistic family\nrelationship. Daikichi is always well-meaning, and you never doubt he's suited to raise Rin, but he does run into a lot of problems that he overcomes\nwith believable difficulty. Rin, meanwhile, is a well-mannered girl who is in some ways wise beyond her years, but she still faces common everyday\nproblems for a child her age like wetting the bed, and she confronts these problems as any child would, so even when she acts a bit old for her age\nyou never forget she's six. The two of them complement each other sweetly but never come across as saccharine--no small feat. They're not\nparticularly complex characters, but they're still charming and memorable, and feel like real people rather than archetypes.\n\nActually, \"charming\", \"memorable\" and \"real\" are good ways to describe the entire cast. From Daikichi's family to Rin's playmates, they all\nact remarkably true to the people we could really meet at these various stages in our lives. The show uses its surprisingly large cast to its full\nadvantage, with every character acting as a foil to Daikichi and Rin in some way or another. For example, there's Daikichi's mother Sachiko, who's\nalready been through everything Daikichi is going through right now, and his sister Kazumi, who's on the cusp of starting a family of her own. Both\nof them initially question Daikichi's decision, but after warming up to Rin and reflecting on their own lives we do see them change for the better in\nlittle ways. The lessons are simple but important ones, and they come across naturally through everyday interactions rather than being crammed down\nour throats.\n\nIf there's one character in this series who deserves special mention, though, it's Masako, the mother who abandoned Rin with her father. When\nDaikichi meets her, she's nothing like he expects her to be, and it turns out her reasons for leaving Rin are more complex than pure apathy. She's\nfocused on her own career and not at all suited to being a mother, but despite her efforts to distance herself she can't help but care about Rin in\nher own way. She doesn't feel that she was ready to be a mother, and maybe she's right, but that doesn't make her a bad person. That the show\nmanaged to portray her in such a light is probably its greatest achievement, and the closest the series comes to delving into the dark side of\nparenthood. Her character arc is so good, in fact, that it casts the show's greatest flaw into sharp relief.\n\nYou see, Bunny Drop falls into a bit of a comfort zone, in that it's severely limited in its thematic and emotional spectrum. Not that it doesn't\nbring anything meaningful to the table, but the picture it paints of parenthood is a little too rosy to encompass the full experience. Daikichi never\nreally messes up, the little mistakes he make and the details that slip through the cracks are quickly forgiven and forgotten, and many of the\ndifficulties he and Rin might have to face are discussed but never actually portrayed, such as the possibility that Rin might be teased for her family\ncircumstances. Am I being too cynical? Perhaps, but it's arcs like Masako's that prove that the show can strive for something more without\nsacrificing its purity and sincerity; Masako wasn't in the right, exactly, but what she did was still understandable, sympathetic even, and it shed\nlight on some truths about parenthood that are rarely addressed. The show needed more material like that, but aside from that one arc and a pretty\npowerful opening episode (the scene where Daikichi takes Rin home is actually a great moment), Bunny Drop systematically dodged every opportunity to\nbecome something more. I mentioned Daikichi's mother earlier, and on a whole I didn't dislike her character, but one thing that bothered me was that\neven after she warmed up to Rin she never apologized for treating her so coldly early on. That's something the show would have been better for\nconfronting rather than tiptoeing around it the way it did, and this series does quite a lot of tiptoeing in its short run.\n\nWhat we're left with is a rather baffling creation. Bunny Drop is primarily a feel-good anime, but I can't write it off as meaningless fluff. It\ndoes have some genuine depth and weight to it, and it's true to life in its portrayal of the joys of family, but a limited scope does take its toll\non the series. The final episode is just like every other episode: nothing particularly powerful, conclusive or poignant, life just goes on. Perhaps\nthat's for the best, as I've had the ending to the source manga spoiled for me and it does not sound like a good direction to take the story, but\neven if the inconclusive ending we got was preferable that certainly doesn't make it good. Not that it's bad, mind you, it's certainly better than\nseeing it try for something conclusive only to fall flat on its face. Still, the series as a whole never really strives for greatness, and that's too\nbad. To be fair, maybe too much weightiness would have damaged the series' charming tone, so I can't fault it too much. Some anime just aren't\nmeant to be great, and for what it is Bunny Drop is still undeniably good.\n\nBunny Drop is a gentle, extremely lovable look at parenting and family. It's not a grand or complex or particularly thought-provoking story, nor is\nit the peak of what slice of life anime can achieve, but it is sincere from start to finish, with hardly single beat that rings false in the entire\nshow. Lack of a dub notwithstanding I think this is something even non-anime fans can enjoy. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Watch it, enjoy it, maybe\nyou'll get more out of it than I did.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"Rin! Wanna come home with me?\"</i></p><p>Slice of life is generally a tricky genre to get right.

That's something the show would have been better for confronting rather than tiptoeing around it the way it did, and this series does quite a lot of tiptoeing in its short run.</p><p>What we're left with is a rather baffling creation. Bunny Drop is primarily a feel-good anime, but I can't write it off as meaningless fluff. It does have some genuine depth and weight to it, and it's true to life in its portrayal of the joys of family, but a limited scope does take its toll on the series. The final episode is just like every other episode: nothing particularly powerful, conclusive or poignant, life just goes on. Perhaps that's for the best, as I've had the ending to the source manga spoiled for me and it does not sound like a good direction to take the story, but even if the inconclusive ending we got was preferable that certainly doesn't make it good. Not that it's bad, mind you, it's certainly better than seeing it try for something conclusive only to fall flat on its face. Still, the series as a whole never really strives for greatness, and that's too bad. To be fair, maybe too much weightiness would have damaged the series' charming tone, so I can't fault it too much. Some anime just aren't meant to be great, and for what it is Bunny Drop is still undeniably good.</p><p>Bunny Drop is a gentle, extremely lovable look at parenting and family. It's not a grand or complex or particularly thought-provoking story, nor is it the peak of what slice of life anime can achieve, but it is sincere from start to finish, with hardly single beat that rings false in the entire show. Lack of a dub notwithstanding I think this is something even non-anime fans can enjoy. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Watch it, enjoy it, maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.</p>","likesCount":9,"progress":null,"rating":16,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1679","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1679"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1679/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1679/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"7099","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/7099/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:50:19.603Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"my-little-monster","synopsis":"Shizuku Mizutani is apathetic towards her classmates, only caring about her grades.

I can't say that you're going about things the right way, but I know that you're a kind person.\"\n\nBad boy meets lonely girl rom-coms are nothing new--they occasionally make for good comfort food, but having been done to death the way they have\nit's rare to find a series that's willing to look at its characters honestly rather than just putting an attractive loner on display to get the\nfawning fangirls a-squealin'. Thankfully, My Little Monster not only averts many of the stale stereotypes associated with its tired premise, it\nmanages to make its leads some of the most believably lonely and isolated characters I've ever seen in a good long time. Love them or hate them, but\nwe've all known kids like Shizuku and Haru. Some of us probably were those kids. Better still, they complement one another remarkably well, each\nfilling in the other's deficiencies in surprisingly clever ways. This little gem of a series really does go to surprising lengths to set itself\napart.\n\nIf there's one word to describe the visuals of this series, it's colorful. The backgrounds and character designs are bright and lively, and yet they\nnever stray so far from reality that it becomes a barrier against seeing these characters as real people. The animation itself isn't particularly\nhigh-end, presumably because it's adapted from a relatively little-known source manga, but it's good enough to get the job done. On a whole the show\nhas a charming, playful aesthetic that's still earthy enough that it doesn't detract from the show's dramatic moments.\n\nThe music is one of this show's high points. It can dive into over-the-top territory with rowdy and energized blaring trumpets, only to turn around\nand perfectly accent a sentimental, contemplative moment with soft strings, hitting just the right level of sensitivity without ever coming across as\ncorny. It's a tough task to pull off, made no less difficult by the dichotomous nature of the content. Suffice it to say that there's not a second\nin this show that doesn't deliver musically. On a side note, am I the only one who got a Peanuts vibe from a few of the show's quirkier pieces,\nbecause I swear the resemblance is uncanny.\n\nBad news for the dub lovers out there, this show is currently unlicensed, but I'm pleased to say that the Japanese track will fill your needs just\nfine. I have to give the voice actors credit for managing to bounce between over-the-top silliness and grounded drama without a hitch, often managing\nto carry their characters with surprising subtlety. I have a hard time critiquing a language I don't speak, but I still find Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Haru\nto be a pretty impressive stand-out performance. From his aggressive side to his silly blunt honesty to his thoughtful, serious side, Suzuki manages\nto tie them all together into one memorable main character and make it sound like the most natural thing in the world.\n\nSpeaking of Haru, he's definitely not your typical male rom-com lead. Rather than the brooding, stone-faced rocks we're used to, he actively fawns\nover Shizuku to the point of obsession. Naturally, this makes him an enormous pain-in-the-ass to Shizuku, who's used to being left alone and doesn't\nknow how to cope with the attention. Actually, Shizuku herself is much nearer the stereotypical male lead I just described, but she still carries just\na hint of suppressed femininity. She's much more grounded in conventional sensibilities than Haru, but just as unsure of how to act in social\nsituations. She keeps her head down and is more interested in grades than guys (or so she tells herself), and it irritates her to no end that Haru,\nwho seems like a complete buffoon, tops her test scores effortlessly. Haru, by contrast, wants to make friends with all his heart, but his brash\nnature scares people away, and those who do choose to hang around him tend to have ulterior motives, furthering his general mistrust for those around\nhim. He generally gets into fights for the right reasons, but that's not how the people around him see it. Both characters are plagued by loneliness,\nbut for completely different reasons.\n\nNot that this show is all sentimental and serious all the time. Far from it, most of the show is actually really lighthearted and silly, built around\nHaru's antics getting on Shizuku's nerves, their friend Natsume overreacting and panicking when things get out-of-hand, etc. Thanks to the show's\ncharming direction it's almost never too dark or uncomfortable (notice I said almost, but we'll get to that later). The style of humor, like many\nother things about this show, is refreshingly grounded, like the kind of silliness that happens between real friends bouncing off of each other\nnaturally, while still injecting a little extra silliness as only anime can. Much like Princess Jellyfish, a lot of effort was put into making this\nshow warm and welcoming, and even the secondary characters have some genuine effort put into them, particularly their new friend Natsume and Haru's\nold friend Kenji, both of whom start out as borderline stereotypes but grow into complex, flawed yet strong characters in their own rights over the\ncourse of the story.\n\nIf there's one problem with creating truly believably flawed characters, it's that it becomes very hard to give such characters proper catharsis and\nmaking such an ending feel deserved. Haru in particular is a daunting character to work with, constantly straddling the line between a misguided but\ngood-natured boy... and a borderline psycho-path. In the first episode he actually threatened to rape Shizuku, but it was so thoroughly\ntongue-in-cheek and he said it with such barefaced innocence that I couldn't help but wonder if he even knew how to insert Tab A into Slot B. Later\nthat same episode he accidentally hurt Shizuku in a moment of passion while trying to come to her rescue, but she gave him a firm scolding for it and\nit seemed like he'd learned his lesson. And yet as the story progresses and we dig deeper into his pit of problems, he becomes progressively harder\nto sympathize with because by the end it's unclear whether he's made any progress from who he was at the start of the series.\n\nI have a no-spoilers policy, and I think it's worked pretty well for me up to this point, but for this review it's hard to explain just how badly\nthe show messes up his character arc without giving away a detail that comes up later in the story. Let's just say that there's one moment, you'll\nknow it when you see it, where Haru comes dangerously close to crossing a moral event horizon. It was creepy and disturbing (heck, I'd actually\nrelated to his character up to that point), and then they never bring it up again. Once again, we're plagued with the problem of a series that's\nadapted from ongoing source material. Maybe they address it later on in the manga, maybe they don't, but either way it wasn't addressed in the show\nand that's what I'm reviewing. Shizuku's character arc is somewhat more refined in execution, but still a little too open-ended for comfort,\nespecially in the context of her relationship with Haru, which constantly waffles about in typical will they or won't they fashion. By the end\nNatsume felt more like the heart of the story than either of them, she had a much stronger grasp on what's important in life. The conclusion was\ninconclusive and open-ended, saved only by the show's strong direction, which somehow managed to remain consistently charming from start to finish.\n\nOne of the most frustrating things a story can do is to reach for greatness and then stop halfway, and that's exactly what My Little Monster does.\nAfter putting so much effort into building up a realistically screwed up character, the show falls into the \"crap, I'm an adaptation\" pitfall and\nstops before it can help him out of the pit he's in. Still, its strong characterization cannot be ignored, and coupled with its strong atmosphere I\nthink the show has enough going for it to merit a watch and hope for a second season.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"Did I do something wrong?

Well, you were right. It's been six months already since I moved to Tokyo to try and make it as an illustrator. Here in this sprawling\nspectacle of a metropolis there are a lot of princesses, but... I'm sorry Mom, that's where the bad news comes in. I'm not sure where I went wrong,\nbut somewhere along the way, instead of becoming a princess, somehow, I just ended up being a freak.\"*\n\nImmediately getting on my good side, Higashimura's distinctive character designs work wonders for this series where other artists might not have even\ngiven it a second thought. The residents of the Amamizukan don't look like your typical [anime](#) girls, they're not designed to be beautiful or\nattractive and this helps to make their awkwardness all the more believable, but they're not repulsive either. There's still enough charm to them\nthat they can be quite cute at times, and when Kuranosuke gives them all makeovers they take on a much more conventionally appealing aesthetic while\nstill remaining completely recognizable. Brain's Base doesn't slack in the animation department, either; movements are mostly pretty fluid, albeit\nwith some occasional hiccups, and show's overall art design is welcoming. The color scheme for this show in particular is incredibly warm, bright and\ninviting, with plenty of flourish to keep it visually engaging. On a whole, this is a shining example of what the studio can achieve both technically\nand artistically, brimming with panache and enthusiasm. It looks great.\n\nThe music exists, I guess. I think they were going for a big city feel, like a tribute to some of those rom-com flicks set in New York (why is it\nalways New York?) and it pulls this off competently, but never really goes above and beyond. There's the playfully seductive piano, a little jazz,\nwhat sounds to be the clarinet accenting its more low-key moments, but it's hardly exceptional and even in execution there are some moments where it\ncould have been handled better. There's one scene in which Kuranosuke is struggling to come to terms with the possibility that he's fallen for\nTsukimi, while Tsukimi is confronting her own insecurities. In between all of this, the Sisterhood realizes that Kuranosuke's boobs are fake but\nassume he's just a flat-chested woman. This is an emotionally complex, tonally diverse scene, and it would have worked a lot better if the music\ndipped and swelled to match these different moments instead of just running a gentle contemplative piece over the entire thing. It's a passable\nsoundtrack but certainly nothing to write home about. The opening and ending theme, however, are both excellent and neither is worth skipping over.\n\nThe voice acting for the Japanese track is top-notch across the board, able to handle both the show's comedic and dramatic sides with finesse, and I\nguess that's all that needs to be said about it. From what I've heard, the general reaction to the dub for this series has been overwhelmingly\npositive, but I could see it potentially making some viewers uncomfortable. This has nothing to do with the acting, which is generally pretty solid.\nHeck, Josh Grelle as Kuranosuke is a downright highlight for being able to bounce perfectly between the character's feminine and masculine sides, and\ntalents like Maxey Whitehead, Monica Rial, Leah Clark and Ian Sinclair really do pour all their hearts into their respective roles. The problem I find\nwith the dub--and let me preface this by saying that many of you probably won't mind at all--is in the script, which is peppered with dated\ncolloquialisms and attempts to sound \"trendy\" that ultimately just comes off as immature more than anything. I realize that's part of the joke and\nI have nothing against liberal, interpretive dubs that focus on preserving the intent of the original dialog rather than the precise content, it's\njust piled on a little thick for my taste and I could see plenty of other viewers--not just the sub purists--having the same reaction. Give the dub a\ntry, and if you're fine with the first episode it probably won't bother you from there. It bothered me and I still really enjoyed the dub, so maybe\nI'm just nitpicking.\n\nThis show does have some dramatic moments and honest themes to convey, but even then it's often tongue-in-cheek so let's start by looking at the\nhumor. The comedic moments in this show can be situational, slapstick, satirical, referential or some combination of these things, and I'm happy to\nsay it's really funny... about two-thirds of the time. What happened to the other third? Well, maybe they were trying to create a warm sense of\nfamiliarity, but some of the jokes here get recycled too often and emphasized too much for comfort. The first time Kuranosuke accidentally refers to\nhimself as a boy and Tsukimi goes through her \"oh boy\" cover-up singing routine, it's kinda funny, but this keeps happening with little variation\nand quickly wears out its welcome. The girls' \"defense mechanism\" of turning to stone in uncomfortable public places and Tsukimi's tendency to\njump to the most pessimistic conclusion about everything also get pretty repetitive.\n\nStill, even if a few of its jokes are overused, don't let that discourage you because this show is still pretty darn funny. The girls have a wide\nvariety of wacky quirks and unusual interests and the show isn't afraid to have a little fun at their expense, but unlike some other comedies (I'm\nlooking at you, Big Bang Theory) the show doesn't look down on them for their niche interests and they're still likable and easy to sympathize with.\nMany of us know what it's like to have an interest few people share--heck, that's kinda what being an anime fan in the West is like. Kuranosuke and\nhis circle add even more comedic juices to the mix while avoiding some easy cliches. There are almost no \"it's funny because he's a transvestite\"\nmoments, which would have been laziest rout to take; instead, the show takes full advantage of all the social barriers and potential misunderstandings\nthat could occur between a male crossdresser and a house full of female otaku, and they all play off each other really well. Kuranosuke's family,\nfriends and acquaintances are all interesting and memorable in their own ways. Ultimately, the jokes in this show work because even though the\ncharacters all have their quirks, they're not solely defined by them, allowing the show's humor to flow more naturally. This show loves its\ncharacters, and there need to be more comedies like that.\n\nNo matter how silly it gets, though, this is a story of strange and troubled people and it never fails to get that across. The show doesn't hesitate\nto criticize Tsukimi and her friends on some of their anti-social habits, but at the same time it never condemns them from being who they are or\nloving what they do. As individuals, I have to admit their personalities can be a little sparse. Mayaya is spastic and sees the world as an epic\nbattlefield, Banba is deadpan and has a silly afro, Jiji is shy and likes old men, and Chieko is commanding with a maternal touch, and at times it\nseems like there's not much to them beyond that. Still, there are moments in the series that make it clear that's not the case, when they step\nforward to help one another through dire straits. They all enjoy their lives, far more than the well-to-do, \"respectable\" members of society, and\nwhen push comes to shove they're looking out for each other. It's little moments like this that really makes these characters likable, I just wish\nthere were more of them. Tsukimi herself is the centerpiece of this group, and the youngest among them--she's fully integrated into their way of life\nbut perhaps hasn't quite forgotten the dreams they all once had, she's grounded enough to realize they probably won't come true but innocent enough\nto still hope for it.\n\nMost of the show's depth, though, comes from Kuranosuke's side. At the center is Kuranosuke's lack of a sense of belonging, which stems both from\nbeing an illegitimate child and from his fascination with women's clothing, which he learned from his mother. Refreshingly, he's fully come to terms\nwith his gender identity: he's a straight man who happens to like dressing as a woman, but the women he's been with up to this point to are from his\nfather's world, the world of the rich and spoiled. Still, his family isn't demonized either. His father and half-brother Shuu both continue to\nsuffer from the affair in their own ways, and they really do care about Kuranosuke. And then there's his uncle, the incredibly unpopular prime\nminister of Japan, who's more accepting than anyone of Kuranosuke's habit, presumably because he knows the stress of the political world and would\nrather just enjoy life without worrying what people think of him. This is played entirely for laughs, but that's the thing about this show: almost\neverything is at least partially played for laughs and it still manages to get all these points across. I'm not even sure whether Kuranosuke's uncle\nwas intended as a satirical statement or just thrown in there to be silly, but the result is equal parts absurd and surprisingly poignant (at least,\nas a statement; the character himself is just a loon).\n\nSo what happens when these two worlds meet? Where to begin? Kuranosuke starts off treating these girls both as objects of curiosity and as his\npersonal projects; he's fascinated by how different they are, but can't quite wrap his mind around the radically different values they carry or that\ndolls and jellyfish could be as important to them as fashion is to him. The sisterhood is initially wary of the stylish stranger, and it takes a\nbelievably long time for this one-way fascination to develop into mutual respect. Shuu goes through his own arc on the side, and the show does a\nremarkably good job of balancing all the different sides it presents. If there's one place the drama falls flat, it's the romance. Tsukimi and Shuu\nbecome mutually attracted on sight and hardly interact at all outside of a few awkward moments to perpetuate the mutual misunderstandings between\nthem. It's intended to convey both characters' innocence, but there's not enough substance to make it believable. Kuranosuke's attraction to\nTsukimi is handled a little better, it'd have to be since they actually get to know each other, but even then it mostly just comes down to him being\nstruck by how \"cute\" she is. There are probably deeper reasons for him being drawn to her, they're just never shown to us and that's a real shame.\n\nThe weakness in the series' romantic relationships stems from a much greater problem. It's a problem that's very common to anime adapted from\nongoing source material, I've brought it up in a previous review and I'll most definitely have to bring it up again in future reviews: this series\nwas adapted from a much longer, still-ongoing manga, and the adaptation doesn't feel complete. At the end of the show, the writers decide to slap on\nan ending that ties up the basic conflict that kept the plot moving along but offers little resolution to the actual character arcs, which are\ninfinitely more important. Given another episode or two, I'm certain the writers could have brought the story to a more satisfying conclusion, or at\nthe very least they could have left the plot open to a second season instead of slamming the door shut the way they did. What we're left with is a\nbunch of thematic questions and only a handful of answers, so it's a good thing the questions are as good as they are.\n\nWith any luck, a second season will eventually take this series to new heights, and given its acclaim and popularity I suspect the manga will find its\nway to the West in the near future, but as a stand-alone anime Princess Jellyfish is simply too short. Still, that doesn't take away all the good\nthis anime has to it, even on its own. Here we have a series that speaks to the nerds and otaku of the world without ever making itself inaccessible\nto wider audiences. It's lovable, funny, clever and insightful and I heartily recommend giving it a try.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"Hi Mom. Well, you were right.

Birds sometimes fall out of the sky, and sometimes it snows in April. Everything is\nuncertain, nothing is unnatural.\"*\n\nFive years ago, a series of terrifying murders took place across an unnamed city in Japan, forever changing the lives of two young girls. In the\npresent day, rumors begin to arise of a mysterious entity known as Boogiepop. No one knows who or what she really is, or even if she exists at all,\nonly that if you meet her in the night you will be taken away. One night, all the power in the city goes out, and a mysterious column of light rises\nto the heavens, changing a few people's lives throughout the city in an instant. There's a speech-impaired girl who wanders about, surrounded by\nshining butterflies that only a few people can see. Nagi Kirima spends her days like any other high school student, but by night she wanders the\nstreets of the city, observing and confronting these phenomena and their consequences. How are all of these events connected, and what does it mean\nfor the city? Is there any meaning to pursuing a mystery that may never be fully unraveled? Confused? Welcome aboard.\n\nLooking at the series' animation, I'm not entirely sure how to react. On one hand, the art direction certainly leaves an impression. Its dark and\nmuted visuals feel very much like old, slightly worn film footage, which is actually relevant to a key story concept, I won't say what to avoid\nspoiling. On a whole, the tones and designs are simple, yet very earthy; it still feels like an [anime](#), but the direction reaches for an\natmosphere similar to the world we all know, close enough to reality to make the audience uncomfortable. I think the overall atmosphere succeeds to\nthat end, but on the downside the character designs are perhaps a bit too simple, to the point that the plethora of characters can be hard to tell\napart. While the use of tones and shadows is usually pretty good, sometimes it can get a little too dark to see what's going on. Then there's the\ncharacter animation, which has some serious quality control issues, jerky movements and wonky facial expressions abound. To be fair, sometimes the\ndistortions can be used effectively, but on a whole the animation barely squeaks by on its memorable tone and direction, which is heavily reminiscent\nof Serial Experiments Lain but not nearly as striking.\n\nThe use of sound in this series is unilaterally superb, although the show doesn't have much of an actual soundtrack, preferring to rely on much more\nbasic noises to tell its story. There might be some static humming in the background, slowly intensifying as the event at hand approaches its climax,\nand then cutting off to complete and utter silence for a split-second, only to pull you back in with its next stunt. A single low ring seems to\npunctuate most of the series' [beats](#), and the characters' voices might trail off into echoes during some key conversations. It's a neat effect,\nand once again it parallels one of the series' key concepts. However, even though Boogiepop Phantom isn't a very music-intensive show, the music it\ndoes have is absolutely fantastic. Combining echoic electronic distortions with a lively rhythm that straddles the line between organic and synthetic,\nit feels a bit like wandering the streets at night. Combined with a haunting choir it touches on the \"angel of death\" sound I described in my\nTexhnolyze review, and it's an easy soundtrack to get lost in. It sounds great on its own, and it adds beautifully to some of the show's most\npowerful moments.\n\nBoogiepop Phantom was dubbed in 2001, the same year Cowboy Bebop set a new curve for the industry, but the trend of higher-quality English dubbing\ncame a bit too late to reach this series and the end result is just barely serviceable. The Japanese voice acting has its share of hiccups and stiff\nacting, but for the most part it manages to carry the low-key character interactions well and breathes pretty naturally. The dub takes the\ncut-and-paste approach to its voice acting and adaptive script, striving to sound as close to the original Japanese dub as possible with no regard for\nwhat sounds right or natural in English, resulting in awkward lines with wooden delivery. Even favorites like Crispin Freeman and Rachael Lillis\nperform only passably, and the best performance in the entire dub is a one-off role by Lisa Ortiz. As if to add insult to injury, the subtitles on the\nofficial DVD release have spelling errors. Only a couple, mind, but combined with the lackluster dub, the low production quality of the US release is\nquite vexing.\n\nIf the plot summary I gave at the beginning seems a tad disjointed and confusing, good. Boogiepop Phantom doesn't follow a typical narrative\nstructure, and it doesn't really have any main characters to speak of (well, it sort of does, but we don't find out who until near the finale).\nInstead, it's the story of the city in a sense, told through a series of brief glimpses into the interconnected lives of various persons concerned\nwith the Boogiepop incident, presented out of chronological order. It's primarily a mystery series, aiming to confuse and to captivate, and along the\nway maybe make some observations about those affected by the events that transpire. The audience starts off with very little concrete information, and\nwe have to piece together both the backstories and the current story from conversations, interactions and brief flashbacks. There are many, many\ncharacters, and it certainly doesn't help that the designs can be difficult to tell apart (though it's kinder on a second viewing). I wouldn't\nblame anyone for giving up on this show one or two episodes in, but for those who are able to endure it I'll commend the show for coming together\nfairly well in the end.\n\nBoogiepop Phantom is based on a light novel series, and there are several common pitfalls that such adaptations tend to suffer from, some of which it\nmanages to avoid and others not so much. The smooth flow of its narrative in particular sets this series apart from other light novel-based anime--I\ncan't tell where one novel ends and the next begins; it feels like the same unified story from start to finish. It's far more at-home with its\nmedium than most such adaptations, and the writers were brilliant with how they used the episodic format to their advantage, each episode centering\naround the perspectives of one or two characters while still tying itself to the main storyline in small but important ways. If I hadn't checked\nWikipedia before watching the show, I probably would have assumed that this was an anime-original title. It's not the most tightly-written anime\nI've seen, there are a few episodes that could probably be removed without too much effort and it can get a little bogged down with dialog and\nexposition sometimes, as is par for the course with light novel adaptations, but as the series nears its conclusion and ties itself together it\nbecomes easily forgivable.\n\nSo where's the pitfall? Well, Boogiepop Phantom the anime is twelve episodes long, and when it began airing, Boogiepop the light novel series spanned\neight volumes, and awaited several later installations (I think it might still be ongoing). Do the math, there's no way the anime could cover all of\nthat material in such a short run. Thankfully, the core story chosen for this adaptation reaches a satisfying, cathartic conclusion, but it's made\nclear to the audience that what we're seeing is part of a much bigger story. I challenge anyone who finds him or herself seriously invested in the\nstory not to want to know more about what Echoes' purpose was, how Nagi evolved from a tragic survivor to the supernatural huntress she becomes, and\njust what the hell Boogiepop is trying to achieve. We get glimpses of the answers, but if you want more fleshed-out explanations you'll have to read\nthe light novels, which will probably never receive a full Stateside release. What we do get is still engaging, but it's woefully incomplete and\nseems to enjoy taunting us with that fact.\n\nNow that I've gotten the style of storytelling out of the way, let's take a look at the story on its own merits. On the downside, I have to include\nthe same caveat I did for Texhnolyze: it's consistently dark and bleak, and altogether unpleasant, and you shouldn't watch it unless you're\ninterested in the ugly side of humanity. Some of the characters we follow are fascinating as psychological studies but completely unsympathetic and\nirredeemable as individuals, which can be incredibly difficult to sit through. Supernatural elements notwithstanding, this series hits very close to\nthe reality we live in every day, and this can get extremely uncomfortable when it starts pointing fingers at the lies we tell ourselves and the\nmissteps we make in our lives. While this isn't exactly a flaw, it does make the series far more alienating, and the lack of a consistent main\ncharacter to latch onto (there is Nagi, but she's terribly aloof) does nothing to assuage this.\n\nStill, Boogiepop Phantom isn't unrelentingly depressing all the time. It's a mystery first and foremost, and a good mystery needs to keep its\naudience entertained. The series keeps you guessing until the very last minute, but looking back in the end, the clues were all there. Loose plot\nthreads aside, it's a good story told in a memorable way, and that's always nice to see. Since the episodes are mostly vignettes centered around one\nor two characters, some of the episodes manage to pull off focused and effective character drama while still working in the necessary plot points for\nlater episodes, and that's downright laudable (then there's the hateful episode 4). The scenario itself occasionally pushes the limits of\nplausibility and has some cliches thrown in, but the story is so engaging to piece together that this is easily overlooked. While some of the episodes\nare predominantly just thrilling mysteries, they're at least cleverly executed, and at its best the show really can be downright thought-provoking in\nits criticism of these characters' human vices and how they cope... or fail to cope. It's an uneven but wholly immersive experience, occasionally\ncold but never boring.\n\nThis show may not be pure gold, but it's still worth sifting through all its blacks and grays to find the gold in it. It has a compelling atmosphere,\nclever writing, and a some genuinely haunting insight into the darker side of humanity. I still maintain that it feels a bit unfinished and should\nhave been longer, but just the fact that I was left wanting more is a good sign. If you like dark mind-frags, this should quench your appetite just\nfine.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"There's nothing in this world that is ever truly decided.

Repent, you motherfucker!\"*\n\nIn Japan animation is a diverse storytelling medium, but in the West it's a different story. While there are some exceptions, there are pretty much\ntwo types of shows Westerners are comfortable seeing animated: children's shows and unrestrained adult comedies. Panty &amp; Stocking is essentially\nboth mashed into one. Just from looking at its character designs you might not even realize it was made in Japan, they're nearer those Saturday\nmorning cartoons we all grew up on. As a further similarity, most of the episodes are broken into two vignettes like an American cartoon. Unlike those\ncartoons we grew up on, though, this show is filled to the brim with profanity, sex jokes and toilet humor. A show like this could only have come from\nthe creative minds of studio Gainax.\n\nWith a couple of exceptions, Gainax as an artistic group has historically been best-suited to more cartoonish and exaggerated art styles. It should\ncome as no surprise, therefore, that they're right at home and having a big party. The character models are stubby and wide-eyed, in keeping with the\n\"Saturday morning cartoon\" style I mentioned earlier. The show defaults to a soft-lined, bright pastel-shaded aesthetic, but its repertoire is far\nfrom limited to that. Like FLCL, another noteworthy Gainax series, Panty &amp; Stocking is an animator's playground--it doesn't stand out so much\nfor its high budget (though it does have good production values) as its wide variety of memorable styles and techniques, paying homage to several\nother works on both sides of the Pacific. With only a few slip-ups this show looks consistently good-to-great, artful even. Ghost designs range from\natrocious to repugnant, but that's the point. This series knows how to show its audience something gross, and conversely its eye candy dazzles just\nas effectively. Episode 6 and the finale in particular pull out all the stops.\n\nThe music is even better. I'm not really a fan of electronic or hip-hop music, but I can appreciate that it's a well-made score. Pretty much every\npiece sounds great on its own, but it was written for the show and fits it seamlessly, ranging from lighthearted piano to seductive jazz to the\nbouncing notes of curiosity to the high-energy leitmotifs that punctuate all the major battles. Of particular note is the series' signature piece\n\"Fly Away\" (that's a Japanese euphemism for jizz, fun fact) which plays during Panty and Stocking's transformation sequences. It probably\nwouldn't sound out-of-place coming from a local strip club, and this is the only show I can think of where that's actually a compliment. To the\nmusically inclined, I'd recommend giving the soundtrack a listen even if you have no interest in the show itself. Also, the ending theme is equal\nparts adorable and disquieting.\n\nAs far as voice acting goes, I'm inclined to recommend the dub over the sub, but the reason for this is a cultural one that has little to do with\nactual performance quality. Japanese is traditionally thought of as a softer, more understated language than English, but the seiyuu cast does its\ndarnedest to prove that notion wrong. It's an enthusiastic, appropriately raunchy and over-the-top performance that definitely did the show's tone\njustice. Still, crude and crass dialog only has so much punch in a language you don't speak, and that's where the dub comes in. It couples equally\nbombastic and cartoony performances with an adaptive script that colors the dialog with more f-bombs than the now-legendary Black Lagoon dub, I am not\nhyperbolizing. Profanity is no substitute for wit, of course, but all of the lines are modern and in-character, and they fit the show's overall tone.\nJust as importantly, it's clear that the folks at Funimation had a blast dubbing this show.\n\nNow that I've gotten the show's technical pedigree out of the way, let's set them aside and look at the story on its own merits. At the very least\nit's a pretty unique concept, the fusion of children's cartoon and adult cartoon tropes is different enough to make this show stand out, but it\nstill leaves the question of what the selling point is. Raunchy comedy being what it is, the humor here is fairly predictable. The characters are flat\nand the jokes are in-your face rather than subtle, so most of the humor comes purely from catching its audience off-guard. I understand why some\npeople get immature giggles out of this, and I'll admit it even got me a couple of times, but for the most part that brand of comedy doesn't impress\nme. As I mentioned above, profanity and offensive content aren't a substitute for genuine humor, and I've already established in my Pani Poni Dash!\nreview that weak hit-or-miss comedy isn't enough to warrant a recommendation from me. There are some genuinely clever moments, such as Panty being\nunable to remove her Panties because she's wearing shorts, but these moments are few and far.\n\nI know that many people will find this show repulsive and I don't blame them. For those readers who are still blissfully unaware, the ghosts Panty\nand Stocking fight include a gigantic turd that haunts toilets, an enormous woman who produces super-fattening milk, and a penis the size of a\nskyscraper, I am not making this up. Those are probably the worst of the bunch, but the rest of the show is far from tame in that regard. There is\nsimply no way to make this series sound dignified, not with that kind of content. If hygiene is important to you, stay away from this show at all\ncosts. At the opposite end of the spectrum, this show is peculiar in that it dabbles into just about every fetish imaginable and yet outside of a few\nglamour shots Panty &amp; Stocking is never really \"sexy\". On one hand it's refreshing that it doesn't go for cheap exploitation, but on the\nother, if you're going to cram this much suggestive subject matter into thirteen episodes, I can't help but feel that the least you could do is make\nit appealing. Just a thought.\n\nThe writing behind this series is far from impressive either. I'm not talking about the disjointed storytelling, that's perfectly forgivable given\nthe episode structure, and leaving a vignette with a problem unresolved (such as a zombie horde or their dog-like pet Chuck losing his brain) is also\nsomething I'm willing to let slide--again, this series pays tribute to Western cartoons. I'm talking about the underlying arc they create. Yes, they\nreally do try to weave all the story elements (at least, starting around episode 6) into a coherent plot, tying together the Daemon sisters Scanty and\nKneesocks, Panty's hopeless suitor Brief, and Garterbelt's mysterious past. This series may be aimed at an adult audience content-wise, but much\nlike its predecessor Gurren Lagann the plot is, to put it bluntly, stupid. One episode Panty and Stocking will be fighting a ghost in public and\nregarded as superheroes, the next they'll go \"undercover\" as high school students. Why, when Scanty and Kneesocks are introduced as \"the mayor's\ndaughters\", do they never investigate said mayor? I assure you that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nDespite the numerous issues I have with this series, however, there are two reasons I can't bring myself to write it off completely. My first reason\ncomes back to the show's artistry and production values, and I think that's where most of this show's appeal (if you could call it that) comes\nfrom. On one level it's nostalgic, hearkening back to those 90's Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon and Warner Brothers shows many viewers grew up on;\neven if this show fails at wit, I think there's still some merit to its cartoony slapstick comedy. The characters, conflicts and fights are simple,\nbut the presentation is striking and the battles, at their best, are high-energy and genuinely fun. At the same time, this series isn't completely\nderivative either; there's one segment animated in a style reminiscent of the likes of Tekkonkinkreet, focusing on a typical Japanese salaryman\ntrying to make it through his day job and still be a hero on his daughter's birthday. Another half-episode is shot entirely from a single camera\nangle, and there are quite a few other moments in the series that stand out in their own rights purely for the creativity poured into them.\n\nAt the same time, what really struck me about this show is that no matter how crass and stupid it got, it still felt genuine. The writing may be a\nmuddled mess, but when all was said and done I never saw Panty not being Panty or Stocking not being Stocking. The jokes in this series might not be\nmy cup of tea, but Panty &amp; Stocking doesn't care. Getting back to Gainax as a creative studio, I think that the spirit in which this series was\nmade is one they need to adopt more often. It's not trying too hard to impress its audience with wit or subtlety, it's just having a good old time,\nand anyone who wants to join is welcome. If nothing else, Panty &amp; Stocking is a labor of love. The coda at the end of the show basically takes the\nentire plot, throws it into a blender and hits the switch without covering the lid. I'm pretty sure someone at Gainax stood up and said \"hey,\nwouldn't this be a cool idea for a sequel?\" and they threw it in at the end without a second thought. I feel like this should piss me off to no end,\nbut I can't muster any rage against it. It was a stupid and immature ending, but that fits the show perfectly. If they ever turned that idea into a\nsecond season, I'd probably watch it.\n\nAt the end of the day, Panty &amp; Stocking was made for a very specific audience, and it definitely won't work for a lot of people. If the premise\nrepulses you to your very core, the execution will do nothing to change your mind. Still, if anything about this show piques your interest I'll tip\nthe scale in its favor. For those who're doubtful, I'd recommend watching episode 6 to gauge your reaction, and unless you really love what you see\nyou can ignore everything that came before (except the latter half of episode 5, which is actually pretty good). It's a stupid and pointless show,\nbut unforgettable execution and sincerity are enough to earn a passing grade from me.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"Oh pitiful shadow lost in the darkness, oh evil spirit born of those drifting between Heaven and Earth, may the thunderous power from the garments of these holy delicate maidens strike down upon you with great vengeance and furious anger, shattering your loathsome impurity and return you from whence you came.

It's a stupid and pointless show, but unforgettable execution and sincerity are enough to earn a passing grade from me.</p>","likesCount":3,"progress":null,"rating":12,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1683","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1683"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1683/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1683/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"863","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/863/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:13:49.646Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"glass-no-kantai-la-legende-du-vent-de-l-univers","synopsis":"The People's Army led by Michel stands against Vetti's newly founded empire.

We were raised in space, where wind did not exist, but he was\ndifferent. Cleo, you were the wind. I will never forget that first fierce gust as it blew in from the far reaches of the galaxy.\"*\n\nIt's rare but not unheard of for two big-name studios to produce an [anime](#) together--Mahoromatic (Shaft, Gainax) is another example that comes to\nmind. I'll admit, I haven't seen enough by Satelight to be familiar with their work, but I will say that these visuals have Gonzo written all over\nthem, and not in a good way. Character designs are unnaturally shiny and angular, the backgrounds are occasionally good but the garish technicolor\nabyss they call space is an absolute eyesore. There are a few decent swordfights but for the most part shortcuts are rampant, movements are stiff, and\nfor every viscerally captivating moment there are a dozen terribly sloppy ones. The CG elements are mostly reserved for ships and off-planet habitats,\nmaking them obvious but still tolerable, and the CG touches on the eponymous glass ship actually work to positive effect, giving it a genuine glass\nfeel. Still, it doesn't make up for the rest of what goes on. Finally, an [anime](#) I can honestly call ugly. Yes, it is ugly. Moving on.\n\nThe music is actually pretty good, if a bit typical for a space opera, all blaring trumpets and soaring strings. It can get a bit repetitive but it\nsupports the show well for the most part. Still, during some of its dramatic moments it can get pretty overblown. I can honestly say that the most\nmemorable moment in the show, musically speaking, involved Cleo and Vetti simply passing each other by in separate carriages. The scene was supposed\nto radiate biting tension, but the musical choice was so melodramatic it actually became unintentionally hilarious. That's not to belittle it,\nthough, it's still a solid score all in all.\n\nThe voice acting is a decent listen in both languages, but since the setting is clearly intended to be faux-Renaissance the dub ends up with a weird\nvariety of accents, ranging from vaguely British to ambiguously Eastern-European, with varying degrees of success. If nothing else, Christopher R.\nSabat as a pseudo-Roman is delightful. Laura Bailey and Yuko Kaida both play Michel effectively (yes, Michel is played by a woman in both languages,\nwink wink nudge nudge), but with Vetti and Cleo it gets a bit stickier. In the dub, Jason Liebrecht plays a fairly detached Vetti with a snide streak,\nwhich is part of his character. Akira Ishida, however, adds a dominating, slightly vulgar touch while still managing to carry his sympathetic moments.\nIt's a great performance. With Cleo, it's the opposite. His Japanese seiyuu, Kenjirou Tsuda, plays the character's confidence as a cheeky to the\npoint of coming off as a bit childish, while Travis Willingham makes the character's voice resonate with experience to back his confidence. Language\npreferences will split where they always do, and if you can go either way I'd suggest giving both tracks a fair shake. At least, I would if I thought\nthis show was worth watching.\n\nThe \"space opera revolution\" concept has been done to death, and within Gonzo's portfolio alone it's not hard to find other series from which\nGlass Fleet clearly took some pointers, most notably Last Exile. Still, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. While it's always nice to see something\ngenuinely fresh and unconventional, cliches can be comforting if they're backed with solid execution, but Glass Fleet is not an example of this. The\npacing is hacky and sophomoric, jumping between events with little explanation and often giving the impression that key transitory scenes were cut to\nsave screentime. The setting is poorly constructed, with slaves performing manual labor under the whip that ought to be easily achievable considering\nthe technology presented, and for whatever reason humans have no trouble surviving exposure to the vacuum of space. Several key concepts, such as why\nsetting foot on a planet is taboo, are left unexplained, and as if that's not enough, every episode begins with Michel philosophizing at us with a\ncup of tea.\n\nAll of this awkwardness would have been forgivable, though, if only the writers knew how to create strong characters. Despite the derivative setting,\nI'm certain there's a great story hiding somewhere in here. The concept of a savior who isn't cut out for the responsibility is actually a really\ngood one. I would've loved a story of Michel sharpening his leadership skills and gradually earning Cleo's respect and support, and in the process\nperhaps becoming a better savior in his own right. Alas, neither Michel nor Cleo have the character strength to carry such a story. This is especially\nshocking considering the amount of detail put into both of their backstories, but the story fails to make any meaningful connections between who they\nwere then and who they are now.\n\nI've referred to Michel as \"he\" up to this point, but the show makes so little effort to hide the truth from its audience that it hardly\nconstitutes a spoiler when I inform you that Michel is actually a women masquerading as her brother. What's wrong with this? They do nothing with\nthis subplot, despite the implied importance of gender roles in-universe. There are a few little attempts to explore her dual identity, but they're\ntacked-on and half-assed. As the story nears its end, the writers suddenly decide that everyone should know the truth, and nobody seems to care about\nit in the least. Even her confrontation with the original Michel doesn't prompt any development. Her role as a savior is equally underexplored, and\nconsidering she leads a group called the \"People's Army\" you'd think she'd spend more time interacting with the common people she supposedly\nchampions. Her relationship with Cleo is okay, but only just. It doesn't help that her comrades are pretty weak characters to play off of. Her\nservants Jean and Sylua get a fair amount of screentime but no worthwhile development, and the rest of the People's Army is hardly worth mentioning.\n\nCleo's character is hardly better off. His backstory is pretty well fleshed-out but the gap between his childhood and forming the crew of his glass\nbattleship is left unexplained. His apathy toward responsibility to the people early on is especially baffling when we meet his mentor, who you'd\nthink would have instilled stronger ideals in him. To be fair his character does genuinely develop and change for the better as time goes by, and his\ngrounded attitude and unique viewpoint place him a notch above Michel, but it's only a notch. He's not nearly as strong a character as he really\nought to be, certainly not enough to carry the show on his own. It doesn't help that his crewmates are pretty weak characters to play off of. Heizak\nis a big Roman who mans up when he puts his helmet on, Nowy is a wimpy boy who freaks out when his glasses fall off, and Barrett is a little too\nmysterious for his own good. The only member of his crew they attempt to develop at all is his pilot Eimer, and with only limited success.\n\nThen there's Vetti, who could've been the most interesting of our three leads. An egoist to his very core, his reason for seeking to unify the\ngalaxy stems from a desire for power and a need to save his own life. These are the ingredients for an utterly despicable character, but then there\nare his conflicting relationships with Ralph, his closest childhood friend, and Rachel, the daughter of the pope to whom he finds himself engaged in a\nrelationship of convenience that may or may not evolve into more than just convenience. Once again, this is potentially interesting material, but the\nwriters have no idea how sympathetic they want Vetti to be, giving him a few moments of tenderness followed by long periods of him being an\nirredeemable douchemuffin. The backstory they ultimately give him is not only one of the cheapest ways of attempting to make a character sympathetic,\nbut it ends up making him even more despicable, which makes his one-eighty at the end come off as forced. It also doesn't help that Ralph and Rachel\nare pretty weak characters to play off of. Ralph is clingy and jealous and that's just about it, while Rachel starts off as a strong female character\nin her own right but starts devolves into lovesick madness for pretty much no reason at all.\n\nTo be fair, the ending makes a decent attempt to bring all the main characters' arcs to acceptable resolutions, but the plot and character\ndevelopment leading up to it were too weak to carry it through; it was too little too late. A few neat ideas are constantly sidelined to make way for\na generic plot, there's hardly any sense of genuine tension when the true conflict rears its head, and the characters are interesting in theory but\npathetically written. The most interesting character in the entire series is probably B.B., a wine merchant who controls a sizable portion of the\ngalaxy's neutral forces, and the writers even find an excuse to cheapen her character at one point when her wine cellar is raided. There are some\ndecently entertaining moments mixed in, and a few strong scenes that really do work, but they simply aren't enough to make the rest of the show worth\nslogging through.\n\nThis feels like the kind of show where the people who made it simply didn't care. The animation is half-assed, the writing is half-assed, the\ncharacters are half-assed. I almost would have preferred it if this show was truly bad. Then, at least, it would have been memorable. In all honesty,\nI still maintain that in good hands this could've been something unexpected and special, but far from soaring, Glass Fleet never even manages to take\noff.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"The boundless expanse of space, blanketed in darkness without sound or motion.

Born of an American father and a Japanese mother. Graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the youngest graduate\nin the school's history. She then returned to Japan [to become](#) a highschool teacher. However, she was only ten years old at the time.\"*\n\nThe success of a little manga-turned-anime you might have heard of called Azumanga Daioh spawned a long chain of imitators, eventually developing into\nthe slice-of-life sub-genre that many of us know colloquially as the \"cute girls doing cute things\" genre. Pani Poni Dash is one of those shows, and\nthat, coupled with the quote above, ought to be all I really need to say about the plot for you to know exactly what this show is like... notice I\nsaid ought to be. The show's creators decided that putting a new hat on an old face wasn't enough for them, and the end result defies concise\nclassification, so I won't even try. What's really important is that this show is intended as a comedy, which is one of the most subjective genres\nin existence. As a consequence, it can be extremely difficult to give such shows an honest and fair critique. The approach I'll take for this review\nwill be to look at what the show tries to achieve, how it attempts to make its audience laugh, and whether those moments \"work\".\n\nI hinted that this show was rather unique, and that's partially due to the visuals. Production studio SHAFT and director Akiyuki Shinbo are known for\nblending standard animation with stop-motion photograpy, numerous art shifts, simpler color choices when they're effective... what I'm trying to say\nis that the look of the show is memorable, and this especially applies to the opening and ending themes. At its most basic the animation doesn't\nreally impress and the moe character designs are pretty generic, but it always gets the job done, and when the show decides to try out a different\nanimation style they consistently up the ante. The show also makes interesting use of the foreground, which adds an extra degree of expressiveness. If\nI have one bone to pick, it's that the extras are very, very ugly. Considering the extras in each classroom have different designs and they're all\nugly, I can only assume it's intentional for... whatever reason. Overall, though, this show looks mostly fine. I've heard some people say that\nSHAFT's odd visuals are their way of saving money, and there may be a grain of truth to that, but it still leaves a definite impression.\n\nThe soundtrack is about what you'd expect from a slice-of-life anime: relaxed or quirky when it needs to be, a bit repetitive but never really\njarring. This is in part because there are several episodes during which we're taken out of the typical classroom setting and into several more\noutlandish scenarios, and in each case the music adapts suitably. It's not particularly memorable music, but it's mostly fine and I guess that's\nall I have to say about it. \"About what you'd expect\" and \"mostly fine\" are also what I'd use to describe the Japanese cast, which is pretty\nmuch comprised of typical soft moe-girl voices. Never bad, but they don't impress either. The dub, on the other hand, was handled by the now-infamous\nADR director Steven Foster. For those not familiar with his work, Foster has a tendency to take excessive liberties with the material he's given.\nThis includes inserting profanity or mean-spirited comments in odd places, along with an uncomfortable combination of overacting and underacting. All\nhis usual stuff is here, and in particular the voice acting in this show comes off as both high-pitched and wooden. There are several good voice\nactresses here, so I'm inclined to blame that on Foster. Still, it doesn't really detract from the show, and in a roundabout way it actually sort of\nmatches.\n\nSo, even though Pani Poni Dash! is technically a highschool comedy, the show's situational humor has remarkably little to do with actual highschool.\nIts scenarios range from searching for a lost cowlick to fighting off alien mushroom spores to an archaeological dig to a battle against a giant comet\nin space, the list goes on. That's just the stuff that happens episode by episode; even the supposed \"everyday life\" at the school is filled to the\nbrim with hidden rooms, weird animals, and some things I can't even identify, and there's almost always something happening in the background.\nThere's a camera crew that seems to be recording the show (they obviously have no idea what they're doing) and a group of aliens who seem to be\nmonitoring Rebecca and her students from orbit. This show makes enough references to stump even the most hardcore of otaku at least once or twice. The\nwriters put so much effort into filling the school with weird and interesting ideas, in fact, that they completely forget to give any of them\npunchlines. Those are kind of important, guys.\n\nThe biggest problem with the situational humor here is that the writers make the common mistake of assuming that \"weird\" or \"random\" automatically\nequate to \"funny\", without anything clever or relevant to hold the joke together. This isn't high-class humor, but if it's handled with a good\ntiming it can still work. The problem? Pani Poni Dash! has no restraint. It essentially fails as a comedy for the same reason that Hellsing TV fails\nas a horror: it can't set up its audience's expectations properly. It's one thing to hit us with something random and out-of-the-blue at the last\nmoment we'd expect it, quite another to shove that kind of thing in our face all the time without ever letting us build up a sense of normalcy. Once\nthe weirdness stops being unexpected, it's not fun anymore. A good portion of the stuff that happens we're expected to laugh at it because it's\nthere and it's weird, and that's pretty much it. When the punchline to a good portion of the jokes is \"I don't get it\", you know you have a\nproblem. The show will make references simply to make the audience say \"wow, that sure is a reference you just made\". I mentioned that the show\nmakes frequent art shifts, which are handled competently from a technical standpoint, but the writers never do anything witty with them. If you're\ngoing to switch to an RPG-esque visual style, why not make it an episode about videogames? It's not that hard to justify these things.\n\nEven if they don't handle their situational comedy well, some shows get by on good character-based humor, but that's not the case here either. Like\nmany other shows of its ilk, Pani Poni Dash! basically revolves around the antics of a group of schoolgirls, with the added \"gimmick\" of a\nkid-teacher who tries with varying levels of success to act like an adult but still shows her childish side. Then there are the students, ranging from\nHimeko, a hyperactive girl with a hair problem and a verbal tic (maho), to Ichijou, the class representative who constantly straddles the line between\nevil mastermind and... Osaka, if we're making Azumanga Daioh comparisons. But that's just a tiny portion of the cast, especially if you bring in the\nstudents and teachers from other classrooms. With such diversity, this show should have the potential for a wealth of character-based comedy. But then\nthe series completely blows the most important element of character-based comedy: making the characters likable and believable. There's not much\ncharacter to like, seeing as a good portion of them are essentially comprised of one or two jokes, like the clumsy girl and the cosplay girl. Seeing\nBecky's rabbit Mesousa fail to pick up an object because he doesn't have fingers gets old really fast. There's also big, muscular,\nmasculine-looking girl named Zula, and a cat who claims he's God, haunts vending machines, and happens to be another Azumanga Daioh reference. Once\nagain, the joke is that they exist and that's it. This kind of half-assed, repetitive writing does not good humor make.\n\nThe show never gets its characters to play off of each other in any clever ways, either, often resulting in a reliance on out-of-character moments\njust to force out a joke. For example, there was one episode where everyone suddenly decided to take advantage of a girl for being \"too nice\", even\nthe ones who aren't usually smart or mean enough to do such a thing. Worse still, some of the characters can be terribly jarring. Your mileage may\nvary, but it's hard to find Rebecca's \"cuteness\" endearing when she's so bitterly cynical all the time, and an eventual look into her backstory\nreveals that she was incredibly introverted and distant when she went to college, which make her occasional lapses into an innocent child less\nplausible, not moreso. As a result, most of the time she just comes off as a precocious brat. That's to say nothing about Himeko and her goddamn\nMaho, which can become positively unbearable. The reason I said the English dub didn't really detract from the experience is because there's really\nnothing to detract from--the characters already act so unnatural (and in many cases mean-spirited) that it can be hard to tell where the show ends and\nFoster begins.\n\nPani Poni Dash! is ultimately a series of missed opportunities. The few (and I mean very few) moments where this show genuinely managed to make me\nchuckle were when the show took a simple but neat idea and then followed it through to a weird-but-logical conclusion. It's not hard stuff, which\nmakes the show's failure to pull it off all the more frustrating. This series does everything it can to get the audience's attention while failing\nto do anything to deserve it. It's immature, is what I'm getting at, and loud and obnoxious to boot. Just to clarify, I do not hate this show. At\nfirst I hated it, but as I neared the end all my rage had more or less burned out. That's not to say this show is an acquired taste, if anything\nit's an acquired immunity. By the time I finished, I didn't even care enough to hate this show, it had just become boring, which is the one thing I\nnever thought this attention-seeking brat of a show would become.\n\nThis isn't anywhere close to the worst I've seen in an anime; I know there are some people out there who will enjoy this, and it should be easy to\ntell from the first episode or two whether you're one of those people. Despite that, I can't bring myself to recommend this show in any capacity,\nnot even on a \"give it a chance if it's put in front of you\" level. What it comes down to is this: all of the shtick in Pani Poni Dash! I've seen\ndone better in other anime, some of which can't even be considered good. That more than anything should speak for where I stand with this series.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"Rebecca Miyamoto. Born of an American father and a Japanese mother.

As soon as this thought passes through his head, however, he is hurtled through time and space to the beginning of his years at college and given another chance to live his life.\n\nSurreal, artistic, and mind-bending, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei chronicles the misadventures of a young man on a journey to make friends, find love, and experience the rose-colored campus life he always dreamed of.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":50,"titles":{"en":"The Tatami Galaxy","en_jp":"Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei","en_us":"The Tatami Galaxy","ja_jp":"四畳半神話大系"},"canonicalTitle":"The Tatami Galaxy","abbreviatedTitles":["Yojo-Han Shinwa Taikei","Yojou-Han Shinwa Taikei","Yojohan Shinwa Taikei"],"averageRating":"81.66","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"545","3":"5","4":"94","5":"6","6":"58","7":"5","8":"472","9":"5","10":"217","11":"16","12":"542","13":"26","14":"1235","15":"89","16":"2249","17":"178","18":"2995","19":"168","20":"4385"},"userCount":30370,"favoritesCount":1553,"startDate":"2010-04-23","endDate":"2010-07-02","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":329,"ratingRank":324,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"Violence, Profanity","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5122/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5122/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5122/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5122/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5122/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5122/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5122/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5122/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5122/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":11,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":253,"youtubeVideoId":"hzvU8t3TRio","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1685/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1685/media"}},"user":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1685/relationships/user","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1685/user"}},"createdAt":"2013-03-22T04:44:25.625Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-19T07:58:38.856Z","content":"*\"It doesn't matter which path you took, you'd keep ending up where you are now. At any rate, once I met you I put all my efforts into making you\nno good.\"*\n\nCollege is an important turning point in the lives of many a young individual, a time of self-discovery where ambitions are realized, but also a time\nfor making memories to be cherished for years to come. At a university that may not be entirely ordinary, a purportedly ordinary young man is faced\nwith the pivotal decision of which club to join. In pursuit of the fabled \"rose-colored college life\" he so covets, he struggles against the\nvenomous influence of the enigmatic, demon-faced Ozu while utterly failing to confront his feelings for his frosty but charming underclassman Akashi.\nIt soon becomes clear that all is not as it seems, as this man is given the chance to relive and repeat his college years, guided by an aloof\nself-proclaimed \"god of matchmaking\" and an old fortune teller woman. But despite being blessed with endless opportunities, this hopeful young soul\nseems cursed to end up unhappy no matter which club he chooses. What is it that's keeping him from living the rose-colored life he seeks, and is that\nlife truly what he should be looking for? If he can't find an answer, he'll be left forever staring at the ceiling of his 4 1/2 tatami room.\n\nI did my best to make the plot sound compelling, I really did, but it's still very hard to effectively advertise a show about a guy going to a bunch\nof eccentric clubs and ending up unhappy at every turn. The show's animation style is *atypical* to say the least, the characters talk a mile a\nminute, and there's not even a dub to make it easier on English speakers. Oh, and the story is essentially an extended metaphor to boot. Taking all\nthat into consideration, the show seems to have raised a high barrier of entry with the word \"arthouse\" stamped across the front gate, so it's no\nwonder this show tends to fly under the radar. It's quite well-respected in a few circles, but at its heart it's still a very niche title, which\nmakes its lack of a proper Stateside release (and consequently a dub) understandable, though no less unfortunate.\n\nNormally when discussing animation the first name that comes to mind is that of the studio, but in this particular case the director's signature is\nfar more prominent. Masaaki Yuasa is known for forsaking many of the elements traditionally associated with quality animation--detail, consistency,\nrealism--in favor of more minimalistic, free-form style you'd normally only see in an independent film or web animation. The designs are minimalist\nbut still expressive and distinctive. The color choices are bright and diverse but ignore the conventions of shading or lighting, mixed with several\nunmoving cloth and wallpaper patterns reminiscent of Gankutsuou and a few instances of monochromatic live action scenery. Now I get to talk about the\nstudio: it may come as a surprise to some that this was animated by Madhouse. This certainly isn't their best work by normal technical\nstandards--frame rates and fluidity are pretty modest--but the studio truly lives up to its name with this creation, managing to make these simple\ndesigns pop off the screen with passion and finesse. There are some occasional animation loops and the like here and there, but overall this can stand\non par with SHAFT's best artistic efforts. Of course, when an anime's visual style is so prominent, it becomes absolutely crucial that its artistry\nfit the story it's telling. I'll address that question in a bit.\n\nMusically, the show's track is primarily comprised of light orchestral pieces that manage to support its comedic and dramatic moments equally well.\nThe music itself is nothing you haven't heard before, probably even in other anime, but it generally fits. The show has a habit of reusing some of\nits tonal motifs regularly whenever a certain situation pops up, but considering the story is built around a Groundhog Day loop I can write that off\nas part of the joke. It's never abused to the point of becoming a distraction, so overall I can say that this show is perfectly competent in its use\nof sound.\n\nVoice acting is always important, but here especially it's absolutely crucial. Though there's no dub, I must tip my hat to the Japanese voice actors\nfor carrying the difficult script so well. Of particular note are Shintaro Asanuma as our protagonist and Keiji Fujiwari as Higuchi, both of whom have\nlines that require them to speak a mile a minute and manage to deliver them without a hitch. I'm not sure if they had some sound editing to help them\nalong, but good editing only does so much for lackluster performances and even when speaking at a normal pace they still sound quite good. The voice\nacting as a whole leans a bit toward the cartoonish side but it's never flat or dull. I think this show would benefit from a dub simply because of\nthe amount of subtitles you'll have to read to get through it if you don't know Japanese, even though you'd probably much rather be taking in the\nshow's quirky visuals. In my personal experience, I had to pause the video a few times just to keep up with all the subtitles. Still, that's not to\ndisparage an excellent Japanese voice track. I just hope that if someone (Funimation?) does eventually dub it they'll do the series justice.\n\nSo for all the college students out there in both Japan and abroad who watch and enjoy anime, it's kind of sad and a little surprising how few anime\nthere are that make the effort to address life at this juncture. In recent memory, the only other such series that spring to mind are Moyashimon\n(which is also unlicensed) and Honey and Clover. As a college student myself, I'll take representation where I can find it. I should probably clarify\nthat The Tatami Galaxy is more about college as a life experience than as an educational institution. That the show chooses this angle, particularly\nin Japan where the culture leans so heavily on academic achievement (I'm basing this on hearsay, don't quote me on it), is actually quite\nrefreshing, and it certainly becomes more of a boon than a burden, to say otherwise would be missing the point. It could be argued that this show is\nan achievement simply for its choice of subject matter and for the fresh ground it chooses to tread. But the show also stands out for its style of\nstorytelling. What really holds The Tatami Galaxy together more than anything is the consistency with which it delivers its central metaphor.\n\nFirst of all, unlike the infamous Endless Eight, the Groundhog Day loop here actually varies its timeline. Most of the recursions, particularly early\non, feature similar chains of events aside from the club our protagonist chooses to join, and on the surface it might seem like pointless repetition,\nbut there is an underlying arc that creeps up on the audience over the course of these loops. Each episode gives a different angle on the same events,\nand small, seemingly pointless details from one cycle can become pivotal plot points in another. To say that every detail in this story has a purpose\nisn't entirely accurate, at least not from a plot standpoint. Thematically, though, it gets its message across loud and clear as we're shown all the\ndifferent opportunities that can be found just by slightly shifting our perspective. However, the way to happiness isn't through the missed\nopportunities of another lifetime; as an old fortuneteller reminds our protagonist every episode, the opportunity to find happiness is always dangling\nright in front of him. It's a simple message, but the execution is unforgettable, bordering on downright groundbreaking. In many ways, this show\nseems to deserve a full 10/10, but for all there is to praise here, The Tatami Galaxy has some fairly serious problems.\n\nGetting back to the setting I mentioned earlier, one of the main draws of The Tatami Galaxy is the fact that it addresses college life. Naturally,\nit's going to ring particularly true to people who have gone to college or are going to college. As an audience, we're expected to sympathize with\nthe characters for the juncture they're at in life, and it works for some people. Still, even though their backdrop makes this easier to overlook, it\nhas to be said: these characters do not act like real people.That's not to say that they're flat, static or archetypal, they are none of these\nthings... and now I need to clarify. Many of the key characters of The Tatami Galaxy have traits common among ordinary college students you may have\nmet, but they tend to come across more as the sum of their traits than as actual, believable people. Hanuki and maybe Higuchi are the most human\ncharacters of the cast, but aside from them the motivations we're shown are either simplistic or alien, if not both. Some of them still get their\nshare of development, but when the characters feel like they sprung into existence as college students with no prior life experience you know you're\nin trouble.\n\nI could have forgiven all that. After all, we're seeing the world through our protagonist's warped perspective, of course he'd fixate on the\nsuperficial, but now I get to address the elephant in the room. The astute readers among you may have noticed that I have yet to refer to the\nprotagonist by name. Well, that's because he doesn't have one. Throughout the series he's never once referred to by name (not even a nickname a la\nKyon) and he's simply credited as Watashi (Japanese for \"I\" or \"me\"). The intent behind this is obvious: he's supposed to be the everyman we can\nall relate to. Unfortunately, the writing only half-succeeds at getting this across, and the end result is basically an assemblage of human desires\nand flaws, and feels more like a symbol of college students in general than any actual college student I've ever met. I'm not saying Watashi isn't\nlikable; he can still be fun to watch, and from time to time you'll probably feel something for him, but sympathizing with a character based on his\nsituation only goes so far.\n\nI mentioned earlier that Watashi's perspective is warped, and boy did I mean it. The Tatami Galaxy is at its very best when it utilizes this trait to\nits full potential, i.e. when there's a discrepancy between what's said and what's shown, or when Watashi shuts up and gives the audience a chance\nto take in the situation with their own eyes and ears. But this series is based on a novel, specifically a first-person stream-of-consciousness novel.\nThis works well enough early on in the series, when Watashi is stumbling through timelines, misinterpreting his own mistakes and shortcomings, etc.\nNor does the use of repetition bother me especially; it's part of the theme, and the meanings of some of the lines he repeats will actually change\ndepending on the context. Still, when a character says in twenty words what could have been communicated in five, it gets frustrating. Worse yet,\nit's not uncommon for Watashi to explain in intricate detail the conclusion we're expected to draw from the scenario presented. How someone so\nmessed up in the head still manages to be so eloquent is beyond me. We know you're trapped in the \"what-ifs\" of your life, so shut up and do\nsomething about it.\n\nThis problem reaches its absolute worst in the last two episodes, specifically the first episode-and-a-half of the last two episodes, where Watashi is\nforced to confront the manifestation of all the college years he's wasted in all the different lives he's lived. This could have worked if he was\nmore of a character and less of a symbol, but instead we get a mouthpiece spouting explanations for things we should already be able to piece together\non our own. If that was all, the conclusion would just be heavy-handed, which wouldn't be so bad, but then Watashi goes on to explain the\nunderstanding he comes to about all the other characters and their motivations. Looking back at the nine episodes that preceded, I can understand how\nthe setup is present for many of these character arcs, but having Watashi telegraph his conclusions at us does not wrap them up in a way that feels\nnatural. This is lazy, manipulative storytelling that ignores one of the most basic narrative principles: show don't tell. To be fair, the latter\nhalf of the final episode is actually quite fitting, and it successfully ties up the story's central metaphor, but the story's humanity is lost in\nthe process.\n\nFor those of you who argue that the story doesn't need a human side precisely because it's symbolic: saying it's okay to forsake that element\nbecause it's \"a necessary sacrifice\" is not only a pitiful excuse, but also completely untrue. It's not easy or common, but it is perfectly\npossible to merge metaphor and humanity. Revolutionary Girl Utena did it. FLCL did it. The presentation may be \"avant-garde\", the subject matter may\nbe fresh ground, and to a certain extent I respect it for that, certainly enough to warrant a recommendation, but the lack of a human heart holds this\nseries back from being the masterpiece it could have been. On a more subjective note, I have to wonder if Yuasa's artsy direction was really the best\nthing for this show. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but at a time when more and more people are going to college and it's becoming a more\nuniversal part of growing up, mightn't an earthier, more realistic art style have made the show more accessible to a wider audience? Just food for\nthought.\n\nDespite all my gripes and frustrations, the series' merits as an allegory are still perfectly valid, and I commend it for that. The reason I\nemphasized the series' flaws so much in this review isn't that the show is bad, not by any stretch. The Tatami Galaxy is a thoroughly admirable\ncreation that delivers spectacularly on the intellectual front, but never quite reaches for your heart the way it really should, and much like its\nprotagonist it can get pretty far up its own ass. Still, the unique artistry and storytelling set this series apart, and it does have something to\noffer for anyone who's been to college.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"It doesn't matter which path you took, you'd keep ending up where you are now.

Still, the unique artistry and storytelling set this series apart, and it does have something to offer for anyone who's been to college.</p>","likesCount":2,"progress":null,"rating":16,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1686","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1686"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1686/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1686/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"17","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/17/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:30.633Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"texhnolyze","synopsis":"Cult-favorite Yoshitoshi ABe tempts us to witness man's downward spiral in a future overrun by violence, greed, and depravity.

I for one think that it's boring to keep reproducing the same technology over and over\nagain. With Raffia and texhnolyzed limbs a human only recovers the previous shape and nothing more. I've been wanting to create a more unique\nchemistry from the combination.\"*\n\nFirst, let's talk about the animation for Texhnolyze: it's Madhouse, so if nothing else you can expect it to deliver visually. This show was\nanimated in 2003 (the same year another, much more famous anime character first lost his arm and leg) and it still holds up surprisingly well even by\ntoday's standards. The movements are clean and fluid, colors are surprisingly vibrant and expressive, and the use of off-kilter camera angles and\nclever cinematography always serves the story well. The characters' faces are refreshingly earthy compared to the exaggerated and cartoonish styles\nyou're probably used to, and when they do become disconcertingly stiff or grotesquely distorted it's always intentional and used to great effect.\nThere are some minor slip-ups here and there, but overall this is a thoroughly solid visual production.\n\nThe music is probably more diverse than it needs to be, and I very much mean that as a compliment. Most of the time, the show does indeed rely either\non silence or at most a few light echoic grinds, rings and hums, I think I'll call it an \"angel of death\" sort of sound, but that certainly isn't\nthe limit of its breadth. There are some quaint string pieces, a little sad violin, the occasional angry use of electric guitar to accompany its most\nviolent moments, a smattering of techno, and several other pieces that would be difficult to list. Not all of it sounds particularly memorable on its\nown, but it's uniformly spot-on in placement and execution.\n\nVocally, Texhnolyze is appropriately low-key in both languages, but I don't think it translated particularly well into English, mostly due to the\ndirection. Specifically, the script and direction stick very closely to the original Japanese track, resulting in some awkwardly written lines\ndelivered with unnatural intonations in places, characteristic of some of the less refined dubs of its time. That said, the English track is still\nserviceable, and despite having some wooden acting at times there are still a few really strong performances mixed in. William Knight, Liam O'Brien\nand Wendee Lee can be heard taking on at least two roles each, but they handle their roles well enough that it's not really a flaw. Michael\nMcConnohie, Sam Riegel and Patrick Seitz all perform memorably, while some of the less seasoned voices struggle to keep up sometimes. Then there's\nVictoria Harwood, whose only other role of note is Integra Hellsing. She plays the cool, seductive scientist Doc spectacularly, leaving me wondering\nwhy she hasn't had more roles. It's a rough and unpolished dub, and that ironically fits the show just fine. Go with your usual language preference.\n\nSo, there's one thing I need to get out right away, and that is that this show is definitely not for everyone. To put it concisely, this anime is\nvery cold and very unfriendly. I could count on one hand the number of times this show actually tries to make the audience smile or laugh, and on the\nrare occasion that humor is present it only serves to make the series feel even more disquieting. The entire first episode goes by with almost no\ndialog, and the episodes that follow are nearly as quiet. None of the characters are \"good people\" in the usual sense. The show focuses heavily on\nthemes of human carnality, specifically sex and violence. It is brutal, cynical, and at times very difficult to watch--not because it's bad, mind,\nbut simply because of what it is.\n\nI don't doubt that some of you have already decided that you will never watch Texhnolyze, and I respect that decision, but for those still reading\nthere's actually a lot to praise here if you're willing to give the show a chance. It's one of the best anime that will leave you feeling\nmiserable, because throughout its run the story always has a sense of purpose, of saying something about humanity and the world. As I've said, these\ncharacters are far from good people, and taken at face value their problems might not seem relatable, but they all stem from very common, very human\nflaws. Because of these flaws, each character finds him or herself partially responsible for the terrible conflict that ultimately arises--one that\nultimately becomes bigger than all of them--they are forced to face themselves and these consequences in their own way.\n\nThere's also an underlying theme of identity, both as a human and as an individual, which ties nicely into texhnolyzation and the role it has in the\nworld presented. This is especially apparent when we learn the origin of Raffia, the substance that makes the process possible. In effect,\ntexhnolyzation represents the lengths humans will go to in order to survive, but then the show takes that concept a step further and asks: \"Do they\neven deserve to survive?\" As these questions come to the fore, all of the characters have to take a step back and reassess the paths they've been\nfollowing. Shinji, who's always envied the class, discovers how empty the life he had been striving for really was. Doc, who wanted to use technology\nto further human evolution, is shunned by her own people for it. Ran's ability to see the future brings nothing but pain to herself and her\nfollowers. Ichise's arc is the most subtle yet dynamic of them all, as he slowly comes to terms with his new limbs and his meeting Doc and Onishi\nprompts him to strive to be less of a stray dog and more of a man. We learn more about his backstory, about how he became who he is and where he'll\ngo from there. He often stumbles and occasionally backtracks, but everything he experiences leaves an impression on him. That's just great character\nwriting.\n\nThat's not to say that this show is without its problems. As mentioned previously, it is exceedingly cold and humorless, and its storyline can get\nquite obtuse and confusing, which makes it completely inaccessible to wider audiences. It practically demands multiple viewings to understand, but\nit's such an unapologetic dirge that it's very hard to actually want to. The story can get heavy-handed at times--notably, the show's use of\nsilence in the beginning does have a purpose, but it goes on too long for comfort and as it gets phased out it starts to feel forced and unnatural,\nthough this thankfully goes away after awhile. What ultimately saves Texhnolyze, though, is that despite its extremely dark and cynical overtones,\nit's never truly biting or hateful. It may be alienating, but it handles its subject matter with passion, reverence and sincerity, for which I can't\nbut applaud it. It's not exactly \"lovable\", but at the very least it's hard not to feel something for these characters and their struggles against\nan uncaring and unrelenting world.\n\nAt the end of the day, do I recommend Texhnolyze? Yes, but only if it truly interests you. I know that should be obvious, but this show in particular\nis one I don't think you should force yourself to try out if the concept doesn't appeal to you. If you're at all intrigued by this exercise in\nexploring the darkest depths of the human condition, though, I highly encourage you to check this one out; it's a thoroughly well-crafted,\ninsightful, surprisingly rewarding experience.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p><i>\"I believe it wasn't by accident that I picked you up.

I think it's fair to say that Naota has parted ways with his old mundane life.FLCL is a kooky coming-of-age story with surprisingly deep undertones as the twelve-year-old Naota develops through the wild antics of Haruko and matures along the way into adulthood.","coverImageTopOffset":25,"titles":{"en":"FLCL","en_jp":"FLCL","en_us":"FLCL","ja_jp":"フリクリ"},"canonicalTitle":"FLCL","abbreviatedTitles":["Fooly Cooly","Furi Kuri"],"averageRating":"79.93","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"345","3":"8","4":"303","5":"5","6":"348","7":"19","8":"941","9":"33","10":"1010","11":"46","12":"2475","13":"93","14":"4989","15":"203","16":"6936","17":"313","18":"5089","19":"222","20":"8766"},"userCount":48627,"favoritesCount":2141,"startDate":"2000-04-26","endDate":"2001-03-16","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":157,"ratingRank":632,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"OVA","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/202/poster_image/tiny-3c3dd9c2e57c5d8f60059f9c02977dd1.jpeg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/202/poster_image/large-aaa4382e2d089a683af13bfd86aa4d34.jpeg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/202/poster_image/small-bfe111d3b8c9387ba6d265aed217548e.jpeg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/202/poster_image/medium-f261ccc182544a2d6f9702af68f4bf8a.jpeg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/202/poster_image/4529e23fafc229ab53edecbc4d2118de.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/202/cover_image/tiny-3e9953f28e7d0b3c17a2c47620c7136c.jpeg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/202/cover_image/large-ea0cce81405b2f6c69eced3209f91065.jpeg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/202/cover_image/small-9cd9cefbe22243e75c2ef8e09ef30791.jpeg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/202/cover_image/ec80b41410b7dd7e627a382fe11871a3.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":6,"episodeLength":25,"totalLength":150,"youtubeVideoId":"pKMzuuy_KQQ","showType":"OVA","nsfw":false},"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1694/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1694/media"}},"user":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1694/relationships/user","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1694/user"}},"createdAt":"2013-03-24T21:30:46.362Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-19T07:58:22.400Z","content":"Story: It took me about 3 times to understand what the actual plot was for FLCL only to realize that it didn't really matter anyway.

The other side also likes Rito, but they are too shy to express their feelings. Pretty normal for a harem anime.\n\nDoes this mean that they are not fun to watch? Hell no.

Its ability to only attract a specific audience- the\nEcchi/fanservice lovers- severely lowers it's potential.

The protagonist is Densuke Mifune, an average, earnest student at the school for the incredibly well-endowed and member\nof the Eiken club; a club that seems to have various goals, but mostly exist to give Densuke an excuse to hang out with busty and beautiful bodacious\nbabes and get in erotic and, supposedly humorous, situations. These girls are fine and all, but Densuke really has his eye on, who else, but the most\nattractive girl at school, the red-headed Chiharu Shinonome. Throughout the course of the the two-episode OVA series, Densuke enters a local\ncompetition involving risque events in order to earn enough money to purchase a gift for his crush, gets in misunderstandings, attempts to ward of his\nsister, gets in misunderstandings, encounters a potential rival to Chiharu's affections, and gets in misunderstandings. So, in all in all, a typical\nplot for a couple of episodes of any harem. This is not bad, but what *is* bad, is the execution.\n\nEiken has fan-service in butt-loads, and breast-loads for that matter. The entire series is wrong in numerous ways, and while ecchi anime now-a-days\nhave gone farther, Eiken is still up there and as pretty messed up and perverse. The fan-service really pushes it, I even found some of it offensive\nas a woman, and I'm a man. However, the thing, or should I say things, that I found to be the greatest flaw in this series, is the breasts. Now, I\nlike huge 'talent', but some of the girls in Eiken are not girls, they are paired-up beached whales with tails in the shape of a girl's body.\nEiken, if anything, is a huge spit in the face at the laws of physics and body shape. Beyond the insane character designs, the animation was not\n*that* bad. Not good, but not bad either. The same can be said of the soundtrack. It's not bad, but it's forgettable. At least it was not an assault\non my ears as much as the show was an assault on my eyes.\n\nBeyond animation and sound, Eiken is terrible. It attempts to be comedic, but it's jokes fall flat and are meant to do nothing more but provide more\nfan-service. At times, Eiken even seems to be a parody of the harem genre, purposely making fun of the tropes often associated with harems. However,\nthe way Eiken approaches it, is similar to putting crap on a stick and saying, \"Hey! Look! This is the harem genre! Hur hur hur!\" This is good for a\nfew laughs, but in the end, it's still only crap on a stick; it's going to stink and you're going to be left awkwardly holding a dirty stick.\n\nTo summarize, Eiken is a disaster of an anime. However, I actually recommend watching it, if only to see how horrible an anime could truly be, and in\neffect give you a better appreciation for all anime series that are not Eiken.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>A comedy, harem, ecchi series of two OVAs based on the manga of the same name, Eiken is, to put it bluntly, over-the-top, offensive, garbage.

You're wondering why I'm even mentioning Evangelion, right? Well, this is because there is a large\nsector of the viewers who watch Eureka 7 without knowing what it's about instantly dismiss Eureka 7 as a clear Evangelion rip-off. And while Eureka 7\nhad several elements equal to(to some people) or similar to Evangelion, it is nonetheless an amazing series that needs to gain more love than what it\ncurrently has, and less hate due to it being inspired by Evangelion.\n\nOnto my review: Story (9): The story for Eureka 7 follows the adventures of Renton Thurston, a 14 year old boy who one day meets a girl called Eureka.\nTypical burst of power happens, he joins the group she's traveling with (the Gekko State) and long story short, the first 15 or so episodes were\nsimply typical shonen. Nothing really happens to most viewers' eyes for this to be any different from your typical \"shonen/mecha inspired by\nEvangelion\" anime. Those first 15 episodes are the point at which most people, ESPECIALLY Evangelion fan boys, dismiss Eureka 7 as some stupid\nshallow plot inspired by Evangelion. Oh, how wrong they were! Without spoiling too much, Eureka 7's story takes a drastic change in tone and events\naround 20 episodes in, at which the story becomes a fantastic coming of age story (similar to Evangelion, but done differently) and deals with a wide\nvariety of different themes, from racism to military discrimination to love. It appeals to a wide range of audiences, and stands out, at a time when\nthe anime industry is struggling to find the right balance between genres. Eureka 7 manages to place almost all of it's ideas correctly and while the\nstory doesn't end without a few plot-holes, it is enough nevertheless to impress any casual anime fan.\n\nArt/Animation (10): The art is stunning and beautifully drawn; the characters look fresh and interesting, and does a spectacular job of getting the\nviewer into the setting. The animation, considering it was done in 2005, is absolutely gorgeous with very few repeated frames while maintaining a\nclean, crisp look. It looks even better than some anime that are currently airing, 8 years later! Naturally, studio BONES have done well in making\nsure that this anime looks absolutely amazing even to this day.\n\nSound (10): Eureka 7 is one of a rare breed of anime where I can recommend both the dub and sub equally; both voice overs sound absolutely fantastic,\nwith various voice actors doing a splendid job in voice acting the characters. The soundtrack composed by Sato Naoki sounds absolutely amazing as\nwell, perfectly fitting with the tone of the series. The various openings and endings are plain amazing, with Shonen Heart by Home Made Kazokou being\nmy favorite opening of all time.\n\nCharacters (10): The originality of the characters was questionable to a lot of people, with several members of the main cast being reminiscent\nconcept-wise to the characters of Evangelion. However, to lay everyone's doubts to rest, the characters of Eureka 7 are developed in a different\nmanner to the characters of Evangelion, and were extremely developed in such a manner that set them apart from their archetypes. The characters of\nEureka 7 were amazingly well-written, complex and likable characters who strayed away from their archetypes and were able to prove themselves over the\ncourse of the show.\n\nEnjoyment (10): This anime is an extremely enjoyable anime, which was entertaining all the way. From the beginning to the heart felt, tear jerking\nending, there was never a dull moment.\n\nOverall (10): While a lot of people would beg to differ, this anime was an unrivaled masterpiece of it's time and a fantastic shonen classic. Was it\ninspired by Evangelion? Yes, character concept wise. Is that a reason to drop the show? NO! This anime restored my faith in anime and it's ability in\ntelling a story like no other form of media can. It was one hell of a ride all the way to the end, and this must NOT be missed out by anyone.

Ozuma has 6 episodes and aired in the spring of 2012 Why are you reviewing it if it aired last year you are probably\nasking? Well, I wanted to keep this short and sweet for my first review, and Ozuma provides me with just the right opportunity to do so. \n\nThe show itself was animated by the animation studio Gonzo, and was directed by Ryosuke Takahashi and Takahiro Ikezoe. ( Ryosuke Takahashi has\ndirected other shows such as Armor Hunter Mellowlink, Armored Trooper Votoms, and a bunch of other titles which mainly came out in the 80s making him\nan old and experienced director which is shown clearly in this series. Takahiro Ikezoe on the other hand, has, up until now, has really been a\n\"grunt\" in the Japanese Animation industry, with this project being his real breakthrough series as a director). \n\nOzuma is quite the find in todays industry, mainly because the anime has an original feel to it because it breaks away from the mould by showing a\nlittle imagination. Everything from the setting, the plot to the characters has a new and original feel, these aspects combined with the unique story\nreally makes the anime shine in my opinion.\n\nSetting\n\nBefore I can even talk about the story, I will have to explain the settings of the Anime. The setting is set some time in the earth's distant future,\nwhere the ozone layer has been completely eradicated, leaving the earth defenceless to the radiation from the sun. Earth's environment has been\neffected directly from this, which has lead to both infertility in the soil, but as well as the many array of earths creatures, the\ninfertile environment has lead to a break down in the food chain, ultimately leading towards the extinction of the human race, what also doesn't\nreally help the situation, is the lack of procreation due to the infertility in animals. I really like the setting, as it is something that hasn't\nreally been explored before, as much as it bothers me, unfortunately a post apocalyptic future is rarely hinted in anime, yet in the west, post\napocalyptic films, games and even books are rather common. It is nice to see Gonzo taking a risk with a rather foreign setting and plot, than just\nsetting the story in a god damn high school. \n\nStory\n\nNow that we have established the setting of the anime, I can swiftly move onto the story. The story follows the travels of Sam Coyne, a scout who\nworks on a trading vessel called Bardanos. This is all fine and well until one scouting mission where he comes across a woman being chased by the\narmy. This is where the story changes and in turn, so does Sam's life as he takes it upon himself to rescue the enigmatic woman and return her back\nto the Bardanos. This is the main concept and I don't want to explain any more of the story, as there are a lot of twists and turns and character\ndevelopment crammed into each episode (as there is only 6 episodes), I'd hate to spoil it for you. \n\nI was happy with the over all story, however it seemed to make little sense though, there are aspects of the show which are not really explained well,\nsuch as the sand submarines, the army, to the setting. It really wasn't explained too well, which did lead me to confusion. The story felt rushed, as\nthey tried to cram a lot of information which would normally last 2 episodes, into half an episode, which, once again is to be expected as they had\nonly 6 episodes to work with. I feel that the anime would of benefited greatly, if it were to have more episodes, to explain the story more clearly,\nto other aspects of the show including character development, instead of ramming so much information down the viewers neck each episode causing them\nto choke on confusion and eventually lose track of what on earth is going on. A great example of this, is when the Bardanos all of a sudden decides\nthat flying is too mainstream, and that digging through sand would be a better choice.\n\nCharacters\n\nIt is said that characters drive the story forwards, which is absolutely correct, since most stories follow the three step flow theory and no, I'm\nnot going to explain that, so go use the magical website called google. (the exception to this, being certain shows, that follow the slice of life and\nmoé route, i.e. Lucky star) Ozuma is no exception, the characters are what predominantly drive the story forwards and it is their motives, and their\ndreams which push the story in the right direction. A lot is depending on these characters to intrigue the viewer into even giving a damn about the\nstory. \n\nSam is our main protagonist, I mentioned him briefly before when discussing the plot of the story, he is charismatic, adventurous and is determined to\nachieve his dream of capturing a sand whale. His dream of capturing a sand whale is greatly influenced by the fact that his older brother went missing\nwhile searching for the sand whale. However, this character was as interesting as a bar of soap, and is the weakest character in my opinion, at times\nhe'd only be doing something because his brother said some great words. It was a shame to see this unravel, as it almost felt that Sam had no say in\nwhat he was doing, and was merely a puppet, merely pushing the story forwards.\n\nOnto the next character, Maya. Maya is the mysterious woman who our trusty Sam rescued before hand, after being taken in by the bardanos, she, at\nfirst is rather quiet and shy I guess you could say (or maybe she is hiding something?), however she slowly opens up to the rest of the characters and\nmoves the story on nicely. She like Sam is really undeveloped in my opinion, at times she is unusually quiet, which seriously effects the plot and had\nme frustrated at times, however she is really important to the overall story, and it's a shame to admit it a real let down to the story.\n\nThe rest of the characters are by far more interesting than the main characters, and most of them are hardly in the show, at times i'd be more\ninterested in Captain Bainas (The captain of the bardanos), rather than what the directors wanted me to be concerned about, I've mentioned this\nbefore about how the show could of benefited greatly from more episodes, and I also mentioned about an extra 6 episodes would help. However I would\nalso like to consider the addition of another 44 episodes. 44? are you mad? No, no I am not, introducing the show Eureka Seven, a 50 episode long\nanime, with a similar scenario, of a group of characters effectively living on a \"ship\" fighting off the military. In those 50 episodes they managed\nto develop the characters so they were likeable, as well as expand on the other \"side\" characters. I'm not expecting much, or maybe I am expecting\ntoo much? But it really does annoy me how bad the main characters were compared to the hardly mentioned \"side\" characters.\n\nAnimation\n\nAn animation has to look visually inviting for it to succeed, and with that in mind, on to the production of the show. The Animation of the show is\nvery stylised, and breaks away from the typical shit we see now a days, usually Kyoto Ani spawns and countless CLAMP shows. (P.S. Fuck Clamp). I will\nadmit that I was impressed by the style of the animation, from the character designs to the settings. However, there are 2 key flaws with the\nanimation of this show which really drags it down in my opinion.\n\nThe first flaw would be the flow of the animation, or should I say lack of flow in the animation. The animation seemed choppy and I just couldn't get\nit out of my head. Most people I've spoken to have said that It looks fine, but maybe I've been spoiled by Redline and every single Bones show ever.\n(that was an obviously exaggerated). It is watchable, it runs over the magic 12 frames per second that magically creates an illusion of movement in a\nseries of still images (P.S. that is not the frame per second rate of the show, just how many frames your eyes process per second) so all in all, the\nanimation was average.\n\nMusic\n\nI was fairly pleased with the soundtrack that Ozuma presented. It matched the setting and feel of the show perfectly. You could tell that it was good\nwhen you don't notice it too much since it helps emerge you into the show. The soundtrack of the show covered a wide range of music, from up beat\nmusic to angelic choir music, the soundtrack almost covered everything. The opening for this show was absolutely fantastic and very unique. Unique?\nyou ask? Well there are two versions of the opening, one version in Japanese and one version in English, take that and add some pretty awesome J-Rock\nand you've got yourself a tune. The ending on the other hand was on the complete other end of the spectrum. The show's ending was calm and\nmelancholic, compared to the upbeat opening. I thoroughly enjoyed both the opening and the ending, however that statement is subjective and I'm\npretty sure not all of you will like them just as much as I do.\n\nEnjoyment\n\nI absolutely loved watching , the unique story, the fast pace and the short amount of episodes really made it fun to watch. I originally watched the\nshow weekly and found it pointless, yet when I re-watched it (to make this review) I found it much more enjoyable since I marathoned it. The show\nitself is easy to marathon due to the short amount of episodes and I'm sure that the storyline will captivate you, as much as it captivated me. \n\nFinal verdict\n\nOzuma is a break from the mould and really helps to prove that Moe is not needed to sell. However due to an average budget and short amount of\nepisodes, the show falls short on several occasions. I would highly recommend you go watch Ozuma since it's really easy to watch and I'm sure you\nwon't regret it.\n\nOzuma gains a 6 out of 10 for being creative and unique, however lack of episodes and budget really let the show down.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>Today's review will be on Ozuma. Ozuma has 6 episodes and aired in the spring of 2012 Why are you reviewing it if it aired last year you are probably asking? Well, I wanted to keep this short and sweet for my first review, and Ozuma provides me with just the right opportunity to do so. </p><p>The show itself was animated by the animation studio Gonzo, and was directed by Ryosuke Takahashi and Takahiro Ikezoe. ( Ryosuke Takahashi has directed other shows such as Armor Hunter Mellowlink, Armored Trooper Votoms, and a bunch of other titles which mainly came out in the 80s making him an old and experienced director which is shown clearly in this series. Takahiro Ikezoe on the other hand, has, up until now, has really been a \"grunt\" in the Japanese Animation industry, with this project being his real breakthrough series as a director). </p><p>Ozuma is quite the find in todays industry, mainly because the anime has an original feel to it because it breaks away from the mould by showing a little imagination. Everything from the setting, the plot to the characters has a new and original feel, these aspects combined with the unique story really makes the anime shine in my opinion.</p><p>Setting</p><p>Before I can even talk about the story, I will have to explain the settings of the Anime. The setting is set some time in the earth's distant future, where the ozone layer has been completely eradicated, leaving the earth defenceless to the radiation from the sun. Earth's environment has been effected directly from this, which has lead to both infertility in the soil, but as well as the many array of earths creatures, the infertile environment has lead to a break down in the food chain, ultimately leading towards the extinction of the human race, what also doesn't really help the situation, is the lack of procreation due to the infertility in animals. I really like the setting, as it is something that hasn't really been explored before, as much as it bothers me, unfortunately a post apocalyptic future is rarely hinted in anime, yet in the west, post apocalyptic films, games and even books are rather common. It is nice to see Gonzo taking a risk with a rather foreign setting and plot, than just setting the story in a god damn high school. </p><p>Story</p><p>Now that we have established the setting of the anime, I can swiftly move onto the story. The story follows the travels of Sam Coyne, a scout who works on a trading vessel called Bardanos. This is all fine and well until one scouting mission where he comes across a woman being chased by the army. This is where the story changes and in turn, so does Sam's life as he takes it upon himself to rescue the enigmatic woman and return her back to the Bardanos. This is the main concept and I don't want to explain any more of the story, as there are a lot of twists and turns and character development crammed into each episode (as there is only 6 episodes), I'd hate to spoil it for you. </p><p>I was happy with the over all story, however it seemed to make little sense though, there are aspects of the show which are not really explained well, such as the sand submarines, the army, to the setting. It really wasn't explained too well, which did lead me to confusion. The story felt rushed, as they tried to cram a lot of information which would normally last 2 episodes, into half an episode, which, once again is to be expected as they had only 6 episodes to work with. I feel that the anime would of benefited greatly, if it were to have more episodes, to explain the story more clearly, to other aspects of the show including character development, instead of ramming so much information down the viewers neck each episode causing them to choke on confusion and eventually lose track of what on earth is going on. A great example of this, is when the Bardanos all of a sudden decides that flying is too mainstream, and that digging through sand would be a better choice.</p><p>Characters</p><p>It is said that characters drive the story forwards, which is absolutely correct, since most stories follow the three step flow theory and no, I'm not going to explain that, so go use the magical website called google. (the exception to this, being certain shows, that follow the slice of life and moé route, i.e. Lucky star) Ozuma is no exception, the characters are what predominantly drive the story forwards and it is their motives, and their dreams which push the story in the right direction. A lot is depending on these characters to intrigue the viewer into even giving a damn about the story. </p><p>Sam is our main protagonist, I mentioned him briefly before when discussing the plot of the story, he is charismatic, adventurous and is determined to achieve his dream of capturing a sand whale. His dream of capturing a sand whale is greatly influenced by the fact that his older brother went missing while searching for the sand whale. However, this character was as interesting as a bar of soap, and is the weakest character in my opinion, at times he'd only be doing something because his brother said some great words. It was a shame to see this unravel, as it almost felt that Sam had no say in what he was doing, and was merely a puppet, merely pushing the story forwards.</p><p>Onto the next character, Maya. Maya is the mysterious woman who our trusty Sam rescued before hand, after being taken in by the bardanos, she, at first is rather quiet and shy I guess you could say (or maybe she is hiding something?), however she slowly opens up to the rest of the characters and moves the story on nicely. She like Sam is really undeveloped in my opinion, at times she is unusually quiet, which seriously effects the plot and had me frustrated at times, however she is really important to the overall story, and it's a shame to admit it a real let down to the story.</p><p>The rest of the characters are by far more interesting than the main characters, and most of them are hardly in the show, at times i'd be more interested in Captain Bainas (The captain of the bardanos), rather than what the directors wanted me to be concerned about, I've mentioned this before about how the show could of benefited greatly from more episodes, and I also mentioned about an extra 6 episodes would help. However I would also like to consider the addition of another 44 episodes. 44? are you mad? No, no I am not, introducing the show Eureka Seven, a 50 episode long anime, with a similar scenario, of a group of characters effectively living on a \"ship\" fighting off the military. In those 50 episodes they managed to develop the characters so they were likeable, as well as expand on the other \"side\" characters. I'm not expecting much, or maybe I am expecting too much?

Accepting these roles, however, might not come easy when faced with the dark and shocking truths of society, and the impending havoc born from the new world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":110,"titles":{"en":"From the New World","en_jp":"Shinsekai yori","en_us":"From the New World","ja_jp":"新世界より"},"canonicalTitle":"Shinsekai yori","abbreviatedTitles":["Shin Sekai yori"],"averageRating":"81.58","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"536","3":"5","4":"123","5":"8","6":"147","7":"14","8":"813","9":"22","10":"493","11":"26","12":"1173","13":"75","14":"2842","15":"127","16":"4179","17":"273","18":"4948","19":"191","20":"7049"},"userCount":53908,"favoritesCount":1979,"startDate":"2012-09-29","endDate":"2013-03-23","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":138,"ratingRank":346,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6887/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6887/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6887/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6887/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/6887/original.png","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6887/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6887/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6887/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/6887/original.png","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":25,"episodeLength":22,"totalLength":550,"youtubeVideoId":"oYWBoSDpwdQ","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1706/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1706/media"}},"user":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1706/relationships/user","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1706/user"}},"createdAt":"2013-03-30T03:18:26.449Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-19T07:58:22.486Z","content":"*From the New World* has some fascinating and intelligent ideas behind it.

is definitely a must watch this season. ^-^ </p>","likesCount":0,"progress":null,"rating":16,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false}],"meta":{"count":13187},"links":{"first":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=0","prev":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=120","next":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=160","last":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews?include=media&page%5Blimit%5D=20&page%5Boffset%5D=13167"},"headers":{"date":"Mon, 06 Jun 2022 07:16:04 GMT","content-type":"application/vnd.api+json","transfer-encoding":"chunked","connection":"close","x-frame-options":"SAMEORIGIN","x-xss-protection":"1; mode=block","x-content-type-options":"nosniff","x-download-options":"noopen","x-permitted-cross-domain-policies":"none","referrer-policy":"strict-origin-when-cross-origin","vary":"Accept, Origin","etag":"W/\"23ca27aaa6c41742b9f666ef4a2fc074\"","cache-control":"max-age=0, private, must-revalidate","x-request-id":"f9935943-8fd1-4dde-a4b7-f246c406830a","x-runtime":"0.281713","strict-transport-security":"max-age=31536000; preload","cf-cache-status":"DYNAMIC","expect-ct":"max-age=604800, report-uri=\"https://report-uri.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/beacon/expect-ct\"","report-to":"{\"endpoints\":[{\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\/report\\/v3?s=l2iENL5th3FXHEwwKr8cXIYfCh%2F1ZpSCshGXU94XEAmUUorok48HMIv7oS2EATB96V87bsmHM91dDAhSaNz%2BGEoCVZAu9qBX4RrMJ68TfXVcdWlVLKW7Yl4Lkg%3D%3D\"}],\"group\":\"cf-nel\",\"max_age\":604800}","nel":"{\"success_fraction\":0,\"report_to\":\"cf-nel\",\"max_age\":604800}","server":"cloudflare","cf-ray":"716f5c43ac07744b-LHR","alt-svc":"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400, h3-29=\":443\"; ma=86400"}},{"data":[{"id":"1711","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1711"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1711/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1711/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"2663","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2663/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:41:38.946Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"sketchbook-full-color-s","synopsis":"Sora Kajiwara is a shy first year who joined the art club at her school.

Other than that the story are just like any other anime who have the same genre, how a really weak team are getting better and finally be the strongest team (although the story was cut off in the anime and the manga will continue after that).</p><p>Some problem that i find are #1 the techniques in this anime sometimes are so exaggerating, because if you see in the real game (NFL) technique like Sena Devil Bat Ghost are rarely do instead they use only power, but some techniques like Monta Devil Backfire sometimes been used by a player or so on. And lastly about the story that was cutoff. Because if you see only the anime, you will be leave guessing what to happen next (although the anime cut off the manga until the end, because in the epilogue you can see the player in Eyeshield play in NFL(after manga).</p><p>In the end if you love sports anime or the sport itself i reccomend you to watch it</p>","likesCount":0,"progress":null,"rating":16,"source":"hummingbird","spoiler":false},{"id":"1716","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1716"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1716/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1716/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"6678","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/6678/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T17:43:34.832Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"akb0048-first-stage","synopsis":"After an interplanetary war at the beginning of the 21st century, planet Earth has been left in ruins, with much of its ecosystem completely destroyed.

The various events occurred during the fight seem to be independent of each other at the first glance, but they're converging on one event as if they were attracted by something. \nBased on the game by GIGA.\n(Source: ANN)","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en_jp":"Baldr Force Exe Resolution","ja_jp":"バルドフォース　エグゼ　レソリューション"},"canonicalTitle":"Baldr Force Exe Resolution","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"62.88","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"21","3":"0","4":"20","5":"1","6":"36","7":"0","8":"75","9":"1","10":"100","11":"0","12":"187","13":"3","14":"201","15":"1","16":"90","17":"0","18":"30","19":"0","20":"40"},"userCount":1675,"favoritesCount":2,"startDate":"2006-11-10","endDate":"2007-04-04","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":3820,"ratingRank":8859,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"Mild Nudity","subtype":"OVA","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1511/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1511/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1511/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1511/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1511/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":null,"episodeCount":4,"episodeLength":30,"totalLength":120,"youtubeVideoId":"6AAu5BIkNEg","showType":"OVA","nsfw":false},"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1721/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1721/media"}},"user":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1721/relationships/user","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1721/user"}},"createdAt":"2013-03-31T18:29:36.852Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-19T08:01:48.956Z","content":"Story: 8/10The story isn't very original, but it does keep you entertained and just a warning, your head might explode after watching this.

We do get some background on Saya and Diva, which I'll let you watch and figure out for yourself. I'm not going to spoil it for you.\nWe get further background on all the characters, but its relatively minor and quite honestly a little boring. The story is really all Blood+ has going\nfor it, but then it doesn't even really succeed to some degrees. Art: 6/10I don't like it. Production I.G. has, for once, failed in my book and\nreally dropped the ball on this one. It didn't have anything remarkable, remarkable action scenes and no really remarkable animation quality. It was\ntruly quite drab and easily on of I.G.'s worst works in recent years. If you like good animation, steer clear!Sound: 6/10The OST was fine for the\nmost part, but it just felt like I heard it before. I guess if I could coin a term, I'd say \"cliched music\". It just wasn't all that great. Out of\nthe 4 Openings, I'd have to say they were all just equally bad or annoying. It's best to spare yourself, just skip the Opening songs. Also, the 4\nEndings, were just as annoying as the 4 Openings. Avoid those pieces of trash as well. Don't say I didn't warn you of UGHness.Character: 3/10There\nare only 3 characters I really had sympathy for in the end -- Riku, Lulu and Joel. Everyone else could've and should've died. I felt absolutely no\nsympathy for anyone but those 3. Saya was a whiney little you-know-what, Solomon, Kai and Hagi were freakin' tools, need I go on? I will. David was\npretty useless, he was a human shield for most the series. Louis ate food for most of the series. DO I GO ON? Amshel, Nathan, Carl and James just sat\naround drinking wine for most of the series. Van was eating candy for half the series and talking in his accent like he's freaking... UGH. I hate all\nor most of the characters in Blood+, as you can see.Enjoyment: 5/10I didn't enjoy this for the most part, the staff loved to put random, needless\nfillers to kick it up to 50 episodes. Blood+ didn't need 50 episodes! They could fit all the series in about 36-38 episodes, not 50! Needless to say,\nBlood+ was a terrible chore to get through.Overall: 6/10It was a slow, painful trackwreck. Unappealing music, animation and characters were a combo\nlike no other, which ultimately led Blood+ to a disaster.\n\n","contentFormatted":"<p>1 Word Review: TrainwreckFull Review:Story: 7/10Blood+ essentially covers the conflict of Saya, her family and her chevalier versus the evil Diva and her chevaliers, along with a few human supporters.

We get further background on all the characters, but its relatively minor and quite honestly a little boring. The story is really all Blood+ has going for it, but then it doesn't even really succeed to some degrees. Art: 6/10I don't like it. Production I.G. has, for once, failed in my book and really dropped the ball on this one. It didn't have anything remarkable, remarkable action scenes and no really remarkable animation quality. It was truly quite drab and easily on of I.G.'s worst works in recent years. If you like good animation, steer clear!Sound: 6/10The OST was fine for the most part, but it just felt like I heard it before. I guess if I could coin a term, I'd say \"cliched music\". It just wasn't all that great. Out of the 4 Openings, I'd have to say they were all just equally bad or annoying. It's best to spare yourself, just skip the Opening songs. Also, the 4 Endings, were just as annoying as the 4 Openings. Avoid those pieces of trash as well. Don't say I didn't warn you of UGHness.Character: 3/10There are only 3 characters I really had sympathy for in the end -- Riku, Lulu and Joel. Everyone else could've and should've died. I felt absolutely no sympathy for anyone but those 3. Saya was a whiney little you-know-what, Solomon, Kai and Hagi were freakin' tools, need I go on? I will. David was pretty useless, he was a human shield for most the series. Louis ate food for most of the series. DO I GO ON? Amshel, Nathan, Carl and James just sat around drinking wine for most of the series. Van was eating candy for half the series and talking in his accent like he's freaking... UGH. I hate all or most of the characters in Blood+, as you can see.Enjoyment: 5/10I didn't enjoy this for the most part, the staff loved to put random, needless fillers to kick it up to 50 episodes. Blood+ didn't need 50 episodes! They could fit all the series in about 36-38 episodes, not 50! Needless to say, Blood+ was a terrible chore to get through.Overall: 6/10It was a slow, painful trackwreck. Unappealing music, animation and characters were a combo like no other, which ultimately led Blood+ to a disaster.  </p>","likesCount":0,"progress":null,"rating":10,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1724","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1724"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1724/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1724/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"322","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/322/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:05:18.827Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T06:00:03.755Z","slug":"shakugan-no-shana","synopsis":"The world has become a slaughtering ground for the Crimson Denizens, mysterious beings from a parallel universe who thrive on the life energy of humans.

It was just very annoying and frustrating.Overall, I have to give Twelve Kingdoms an 7/10 because it was good story/character-wise despite the fact it wasn't memorable - at all. </p>","likesCount":1,"progress":null,"rating":14,"source":"mal_import","spoiler":false},{"id":"1732","type":"reviews","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1732"},"libraryEntry":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1732/relationships/library-entry","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1732/library-entry"}},"media":{"data":{"id":"21","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21"},"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/21/anime-staff"}},"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:34.230Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-06T07:15:51.023Z","slug":"neon-genesis-evangelion","synopsis":"In the year 2015, the world stands on the brink of destruction.

Forced to battle against wave after wave of mankind's greatest threat, the young boy finds himself caught in the middle of a plan that could affect the future of humanity forever.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth","en_jp":"Shinseiki Evangelion Gekijouban: Shi to Shinsei","ja_jp":"新世紀エヴァンゲリオン劇場版 シト新生"},"canonicalTitle":"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth","abbreviatedTitles":["Neon Genesis Evangelion - Death and Rebirth"],"averageRating":"72.03","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"122","3":"1","4":"131","5":"2","6":"166","7":"6","8":"409","9":"8","10":"673","11":"10","12":"1423","13":"31","14":"1955","15":"51","16":"1778","17":"60","18":"773","19":"18","20":"1357"},"userCount":13904,"favoritesCount":60,"startDate":"1997-03-15","endDate":"1997-03-15","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":843,"ratingRank":3233,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"movie","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/22/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/22/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/22/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/22/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/22/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/22/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/22/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/22/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/22/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":1,"episodeLength":101,"totalLength":101,"youtubeVideoId":"eI8aUqsCovo","showType":"movie","nsfw":false},"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1734/relationships/media","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1734/media"}},"user":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1734/relationships/user","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/reviews/1734/user"}},"createdAt":"2013-03-31T18:29:36.905Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-19T07:58:35.834Z","content":"This review a fiarly short, but given its a recap movie, no need to go deep.

The character designs could almost be\ncalled generic, but this is one of those rare cases where color choices make all the difference. The colors are toned down, almost a bit\ndirty-looking--perfect for an [anime](#) set at an agriculture university--but the character designs are still very easy on the eyes. Other than that,\nthe animation is consistently fine, holding together when it needs to be serious and reserving its shortcuts for the sillier moments when they can be\nused well. Then there are the microbe designs, which are kept simple, cute and marketable. It doesn't look great, but there's an earthy charm to it,\nand that's nice to see.\n\nRather than the usual bouncy music I normally associate with slice-of-life, Moyashimon's soundtrack is a little more eclectic. It can get a little\nrepetitive, but between the few pieces they have to work with I think it manages to span the show's various tones and scenarios quite well, ranging\nfrom folksy-sounding traditional Japanese music to a more modern-sounding triumphant anthem. College is a time for experiencing variety, and I think\nthat's what they were going for. I have no complaints.\n\nWhen it comes to voice acting, the lack of an English dub means Japanese is your only option. Voice work and delivery are, of course, paramount in any\ncomedy worth its frames, and that goes double if it's in a language you don't [speak](#). Thankfully, the seiyuu cast here can belt out their lines\nwith hilarious conviction. Of particular note are Tomomichi Nishimura, whose take on Dr. Itsuki is always a joy to listen to, and the talented Daisuke\nSakaguchi, whose natural snark makes Sawaki's character a lot more fun.\n\nI cited this show back in my Tatami Galaxy review as one of the few anime that addresses college life, and if nothing else it's laudable for that (as\na quick aside I'll mention that Moyashimon, Honey &amp; Clover and The Tatami Galaxy were all noitaminA shows, make of that what you will). This\nseries is quieter, humbler and simpler than its younger cousin, but it still gives a well fleshed-out look at college life and the plethora of\nexperiences that come with it. Like The Tatami Galaxy, Moyashimon downplays the academic side of college to focus more on the element of\nself-discovery, and it makes for a nice breath of fresh air without coming across as escapist fluff.\n\nFirst and foremost, Moyashimon is a comedy. A few of the jokes in this show are a little too understated to have any punch, but for the most part the\nhumor walks a fine line between down-to-earth near-believability and glorious bombast that makes it a delight. The art style is simple enough that it\nworks well for their visual gags, the setting is distinctive enough to set up some scenarios you've never seen in an anime before, and the characters\nare fun and genuine enough that they're easy to get behind even and especially when they're being [complete](#) buffoons. Dr. Itsuki in particular\ntakes his passion for biological sciences to delightful extremes, and the cartoonish microbes themselves can take simple science lessons and make them\na helluva lot more fun.\n\nSpeaking of science lessons, the chemistry and biology in this show are well-researched, as are the elements of farming and business, so if you happen\nto enjoy getting a little trivia out of your entertainment they're a tasty treat on the side. If that doesn't interest you it might be a bit much to\nsit through, but they're generally kept brief, simple and funny. Even if you don't understand all the science and business talk, it shouldn't make\nthe show as a whole any harder to follow.\n\nIf there's one thing that really elevates Moyashimon, though, it's the characters. Dr. Itsuki isn't just a fun guy to watch, he's also a\nsurprisingly insightful mentor and the guidance he gives his students may turn out to be more helpful than they realize. An upperclassman named Mutou\nis still recovering from a breakup when that relationship had more or less defined her direction in life. Kawahama and Misato, a duo of upperclassmen\nwho initially seem like comic relief buffons only interested in money and sake, end up showing a surprising level of maturity and supporting Sawaki\nwhen he needs it most, and Sawaki's best friend Kei goes through an arc I dare not spoil; suffice it to say it's an issue rarely touched upon by\nanime. If there's one recurring theme throughout Moyashimon, it's that you need to find your own path and determine your own future, and college is\nthe perfect time to discover just what that future might be, and Dr. Itsuki's assistant Haruka Hasegawa stands out as a particularly poignant example\nof this, though again I won't spoil why.\n\nSawaki himself is a bit of a missed opportunity, unfortunately. There are hints at the beginning of the series that he used to really love seeing the\nmicrobes, and they bring that \"forgotten passion\" aspect of his character back for a heartwarming season finale while also raising the question of\nwhether he has any worth outside his ability to see microbes, but between episode 2 and episode 11 what you see is mostly him being the straight man\nto all the weirdness that goes on around him. Does that make him unlikable? No, he's still a perfectly pleasant human being, if a bit weak-willed and\neasy to string along. I just don't think he should've been the straight man, that role exists primarily to play off of others and Sawaki could've\nbeen a much more fascinating character all on his own. There were still some nice little moments here and there, so I can't be too mad about it.\n\nI'll quickly mention that second season of the show does exist, and while I don't consider it to be as good as the first season it is still more of\na good thing, same great characters and all, so if you enjoy the first season, I shouldn't have to tell you to give the second a chance. I may end up\ngiving that season its own review eventually, though I can't say when. I do hope that if there's ever a third season it'll set things back on the\nright track. The source material is still ongoing, so it's definitely possible.\n\nMoyashimon is simple but effective look at college as a time to learn about yourself and find direction in life. It's not as complex or ambitious as\nThe Tatami Galaxy, but its cast lovable and relatable characters more than make up for that. It's always charming and never boring.

Toaru Majutsu no Index II, a second season/sequel to the first season. The audience is once again shown following the adventures of a certain man, Touma Kamijou, through the hells of Magic and Science. All the while building his (in)famous harem, of course. Honestly speaking, the Index series has been one of my favorites ever since I laid my eyes on it. After finishing season 1, I waited patiently for a season 2, expecting this series to be more awesome than already is. After the 24 (or 25, if you count the delay) weeks of watching it, I have found myself in quite a shock that Season 2, strangely, didn't live up to its first season counterpart... for me, at least. Let's break this down:\n\n**Story: 7/10** (Good) \nOne of the more distinctive features of Toaru Majutsu no Index is the way its story is presented. Instead of every moment leading up to one giant picture by the end of the show's run, Index is divided into disjointed story arcs, each telling a different story. This is not to say that each arc is completely disjointed, as sometimes, characters and events leak from a previous arc to another. For Index II, the story arcs are more disjointed as compared to its first season counterpart, but with no events being absolutely inconsequential. This leaves more space for error, with each arc being judged by the audience instead of evaluating a whole show. Needless to say, each arc is a hit-or-miss. In Index's case though, the show has a\nsurprisingly good rate for \"hit\", though it will always be subjective as always. What one may notice about the story arcs in S2, though, is the formula that runs through each. Each and every arc follows a specific event sequencing that, over time, will wear the watcher down. The stories in these arcs are actually quite interesting and some even really exciting. However, if one is to note how each arc ends, there will surely be a visible pattern in motion, and certain viewers may actually end up really tired of the procedure. For some others though, the way it ends is pretty awesome anyway so it doesn't matter too much. (But of course, some arcs do admittedly end pretty weakly.)\n\n**Art: 7/10** (Good)\nHints of Index II's art can actually be seen in most of J.C. Staff's other works. The art in the show is pretty clean and crisp. In well-crafted scenes, the way a picture is drawn and the quality of the art is great. Do note though, I did say \"In well-crafted scenes\". Index, despite having top-notch art, sometimes does\nsuffer from animation resulting from cutting corners and all that. While other scenes look good, the series also has its fair share of bad quality moments.\n\n**Sound: 9/10** (Great)\nIuchi Maiko composes great music for the show. That I can really vouch for.Its 2 Opening themes, \"No Buts\" and \"See Visions\" by Mami Kawada are very catching tunes and fit the show's theme and mood. The same goes for both Ending themes, \"Magic World\" and \"Memories Last\" by Maon Kurosaki.\n\n**Character: 6/10** (Fair)\nCharacters. It gets pretty tricky here. For our hero, Touma Kamijou, he retains his whole personality from the first season. A strong determinator, clever... and preachy? Personally, I don't have a problem with him as I do with the others. Some characters (especially one of the famous ones) evidently suffer flanderization. This is especially jarring when a character from the previous season shows a solid personality while most appearances here depict(visibly) only one trait. This can be really cute at times, and actually quite endearing. But in Index II, this trait was overused and for me, became quite tiresome.Other characters, though, are still okay personality wise. As for \"Touma's harem\", characters designs are still solid as always and always a plus.\n\n**Enjoyment: 9/10** (Great)\nBut just because I have been saying some pretty negative things about it, it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy to its fullest. The show drifts from intense and thrilling action, to mysterious and dark atmospheres, to refreshing moe and fanservice galore. The way to enjoy this show is to accept the flaws and enjoy whatever the show wants to shell out. Each punch is precious, every thrill worth the ride and the fanservice all out to cherish.\n\n**Overall: 8/10** (Very Good)\nFor me, Toaru Majutsu no Index has been a fun ride. And I'm glad I watched it. The show has its very visible flaws but will always remain to be a fan favorite as Index does not rely on being \"intellectual\" or \"deep\", but instead, wants to be fun and enjoyed by everyone(even if it means satisfying lowest common denominator). As I said earlier, even though for me, Index II didn't live up to its first season it was still a good watch.  Being a fan of the first season doesn't entail the enjoyment of the second, but it's worth the shot. We may wait for a Season 3, and hope it fairs a lot better and surpasses expectation.","contentFormatted":"<p>So, here we are. Toaru Majutsu no Index II, a second season/sequel to the first season.

past is prologue.\" - *The Tempest* - William Shakespeare\n\nNothing could say more about *Blast of Tempest* than Shakespeare's <i>The Tempest </i>which is heavily referenced throughout the series.  *Blast of\nTempest* is a story about overcoming entrapment in the past, both figuratively and literally. \n\n**Story**\n\nOne thing that can be said about *Blast of Tempest *is that it follows a logical premise that manages to feel legitimately inspired despite its fair\nshare of twists.  Even though the story involves magic, the series defines a strong logical framework that both empowers and entraps its characters.\n\nAbove all, our character's personal history is a major factor in the series.  It drives Mahiro on a vengeful path to determine who killed his sister\nand weighs down Yoshino to the point of near-detachment.  It is only when these characters are able to accept fate and focus that they are able to\nallow a tragic event to become the means to a better end (saving the world).  Moreover, past as a general influence is extremely well-realized.\n Events in the past, including Hakaze's imprisonment, Aika's death, and even further back to the formation of the Tree of Exodus as a means to end\nthe Tree of Genesis's purpose in resetting humanity are central to the plot.\n\nFurthermore, the notion of order and chaos is thematically prevalent in the series.  Even though the Tree of Genesis represents order, it is only with\nthe chaos represented by the Tree of Exodus that humanity can thrive and even exist.  Despite the resurgence of crime and inequality after the\ndissolution of the Tree of Genesis, it is easy to understand the necessity in the action and why the order imposed by the Tree of Genesis would\neventually deem all of humanity unrighteous.\n\nThe only major flaw to *Blast of Tempest*'s story is that it tends to use its characters as if they are actors in a play (perhaps intentionally).\n Each character plays his part, often without question.  This is extremely noticeable in Aika's casual acceptance of her fate despite what clearly\nwould have been a difficult decision - but this may actually speak more to her character than to the show's tendency to have its actors fill a role.\n\n**Characters**\n\nCharacter development is very important in *Blast of Tempest* - and all of its main characters, Hakaze, Yoshino, Mahiro and Aika, are a strong basis\nto the show's central themes despite their differing personas.  What enforces their strength is their intelligence - even in Mahiro's case - the\ncharacters carefully and cleverly plan their actions.\n\nHakaze is a strong female lead that is open and direct, while sometimes being too upfront and occasionally becoming distracted by desire.  What\ndefines Hakaze the most is that, despite her attunement to the Tree of Genesis, she is far from unquestioning.  Her actions are often fueled by her\ndesire to seek her own path, even with opposition or without knowing the consequences.  It makes her into a character nearly embracing chaos despite\nthe order surrounding her - which accentuates her foil in Aika.\n\nAika, though appearing frail, is strong to a fault.  Her character embraces the ideology of Exodus far too unconditionally which is but testament to\nher acceptance with being an actress in a play.  She often quotes *Hamlet* and *The Tempest* because she feels that her only goals have already been\npreviously scripted and she must play to those ideals.\n\nMahiro, on the other hand, represents another extreme of chaos with his absolute path of vengeance.  His early ambitions are simply to avenge the\ndeath of Aika, but this actually drives him to greatness because of her involvement in much more crucial matters.  When he is freed from this path,\nhis goal has actually become to enact a plan to save the world.  Mahiro is a renegade without being overly reckless and ambitious to a point where he\nis not clouded.\n\nYoshino, for a large majority of the show, is very detached.  Aika's death had an opposing effect on him in that he nearly lost desire to function\nafter her passing.  Even though he is tied down by her loss, he thinks clearly and keeps Mahiro in check when he is pushing himself too far.  It's\nimportant to note that Yoshino is the last character to resolve his past as a lesson in history, because he is too entrapped by it.  Hakaze's\nconfessions to him cause him to break because he is not ready to continue his life until all others' problems have been resolved.\n\n**Quality**\n\n*Blast of Tempest* is breathtaking visually and its usage of classical pieces in its soundtrack is excellently done.  By now, this is what we expect\nfrom BONES, so it isn't too unbelievable that this show lives up to BONES's capability to generate quality in its production value.  Particularly of\nnote are the show's excellent action scenes that accentuate brilliant animation along with well-utilized classical music.\n\n**Closing**  \nWhile *Blast of Tempest* occasionally falls short of absolute excellence in its willingness to allow its characters to fill roles, it presents a story\nof past entanglements that is very well-realized and non-contradictory with a cast that synergizes their differing viewpoints.\n\nCross-posted from my blog:    \n[Zetsuen no Tempest: Blast from the Past][1]\n\n\n\n[1]:

more about <i>Blast of Tempest</i> than Shakespeare's <i>The Tempest </i>which is heavily referenced throughout the series.  <i>Blast of Tempest</i> is a story about overcoming entrapment in the past, both figuratively and literally. </p><p><b>Story</b></p><p>One thing that can be said about <i>Blast of Tempest </i>is that it follows a logical premise that manages to feel legitimately inspired despite its fair share of twists.  Even though the story involves magic, the series defines a strong logical framework that both empowers and entraps its characters.</p><p>Above all, our character's personal history is a major factor in the series.  It drives Mahiro on a vengeful path to determine who killed his sister and weighs down Yoshino to the point of near-detachment.  It is only when these characters are able to accept fate and focus that they are able to allow a tragic event to become the means to a better end (saving the world).  Moreover, past as a general influence is extremely well-realized.  Events in the past, including Hakaze's imprisonment, Aika's death, and even further back to the formation of the Tree of Exodus as a means to end the Tree of Genesis's purpose in resetting humanity are central to the plot.</p><p>Furthermore, the notion of order and chaos is thematically prevalent in the series.  Even though the Tree of Genesis represents order, it
